Seismicity in Romania--evidence for the sinking lithosphere.

Roman C(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Geodesy and Geophysics, University of Cambridge.

The revision of Romanian earthquakes shows a distribution suggesting a sinking
lithosphere under the Carpathian arc. Thermal and gravitational anomalies, as
well as petrological and tectonic features, provide further evidence on the cause
and character of intermediate earthquakes of Romania. This is consistent with the
theory of plate tectonics in south-east Europe.

Momentum conservation and some problems of metagalactic astronomy.

Shklovsky J(1).

Author information: 
(1)Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow.

This article explains that bodies of plasma in active galactic nuclei and
quasi-stellar objects-"magnetoids"-will attain large momenta because of
anisotropy in the generation of relativistic particles and in the synchrotron
emission. Magnetoids may therefore be expected to be ejected from the nuclei with
high velocities, thus accounting for several puzzling observations in astronomy.

Can the lumpy distribution of galaxies be reconciled with the smooth X-ray
background?

Author information:

Comment in
    Nature. 1970 Dec 19;228(5277):1137.

The fluctuations in X-ray background intensity that would be generated by
clusters or superclusters of galaxies exceed those observed. It may be that the
X-ray background arises from low-luminosity objects which are distributed much
more smoothly and are more numerous than bright optical galaxies. Hierarchical
universe models in which the distribution of X-ray sources follows the
cosmological mass distribution are ruled out.

Pulsars generate radio waves by an unknown process which gives the highest volume

observational facts which any theory of emission must explain.

Absolute time-of-arrival measurements of optical pulses from the Crab pulsar.

Papaliolios C(1), Carleton NP, Horowitz P.

Author information: 
(1)Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Harvard University, USA.

An attempt is made to understand the characteristics of pulsar slowdown in terms 
of various possible emission mechanisms. Though magnetic-dipole radiation seems
to be dominant, the deviations from a pure dipolar decay are large compared with 
errors in measurement and indicate the presence of more complicated braking
mechanisms, small fluctuations, and major "jumps", or period discontinuities.
Some rapid-relaxation effect is evident following the discontinuous jump in
period in September 1969, but there is no evidence of the quasi-sinusoidal
behaviour reported before the jump by Arecibo. An alternative interpretation of
the Arecibo data is given.

The creep of polycrystalline ice in uniaxial compression has been studied over a 
very wide range of strain rates. The creep is far too slow to explain the
friction of ice observed at very low sliding speeds, but experiments with single 
crystals show that sliding produces recrystallization at the interface, the ice
presenting an orientation favourable to easy glide in directions tangential to
the interface.

The atomic structure of tubular subcrystals of beta-iron(III) oxide hydroxide.

Gallagher KJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University College, Swansea.

The presence of pores in beta-FeOOH (mineral name akaganéite) has been confirmed 
by pore volume distribution measurements. The mean pore diameter has been found
(28.4 A) and the number distribution calculated. With the available evidence from
electron microscopy, gas adsorption and X-ray diffraction a unique superstructure
for the porous subcrystals is deduced which, because of their unusually small
dimensions, can only be formulated in atomic terms.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TS.

Investigations of the phase behaviour on freezing and subsequent melting and of
other properties indicate that anomalous water is a solution containing a fixed
amount of relatively involatile material in normal water. There seems to be no
need to postulate the existence of a new polymer of water in such solutions. If
only water and silica are present, the properties are consistent with those of a 
silicic acid gel.

The seismicity and fault plane solutions in the Mediterranean area show that two

may be a common feature of contracting ocean basins. The results show that the
concepts of plate tectonics apply to instantaneous motions across continental
plate boundaries.

The subsidence history of the Bahamian Platform points to a non-uniform rate of
sea-floor spreading since the beginning of the Cretaceous. Lower Cretaceous rates
of perhaps 5 cm/yr led to an active trench system at the boundary between the
American and Caribbean lithosphere plates, and the rapid subsidence of the
continental margin produced graben faults on the Bahamian Platform and normal
faults in Cuba.

Osculatory packing of finite areas with circles.

Kausch-Blecken HH(1), Schmeling V, Tschoegl NW.

Author information:

Osculatory packing of a finite area by circles requires that any uncovered area
or interstice be filled always with the largest possible non-overlapping circle. 
The strength of this requirement makes it possible to derive a general analytic
expression that approximates closely to the distributions of radii calculated for
various sets of boundary conditions.
