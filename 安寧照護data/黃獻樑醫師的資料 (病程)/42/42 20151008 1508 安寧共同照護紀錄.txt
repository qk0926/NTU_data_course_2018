Dear doctor:

  The 74 years old female has history of 
1. In-hospital cardiac arrest status post cardiopulmonary resuscitation with return of spontaneous circulation
2. Right tongue cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and sarcoma, status post right partial glossectomy and supraomohyoid neck dissection
3. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cT4N0M0, stage IV, status post concurrent chemoradiotherapy(2007/3/22~2007/5/10 7000cGY)
4. Diabetes mellitus

  This time, she came to our emergent department for persisted fever, suspected sinusitis. This morning, she felt general maliase and lean on her family. No pulse was noted by family and nurse. CPR was performed for 10 minutes then ROSC. She was then admitted to ICU for further care. Family meeting with Oncologist was held this morning, and further C/T was not suggested, and the family was considering ventilator withdrawal.  
  家人表示, 病人很怕痛, 且喜歡到戶外活動。2007年罹患NPC的時候就有表達不要NG也不要氣切。現在CPR後出現癲癇症狀，意識不清又全身約束，感到非常不捨。家人雖有考慮撤除，卻對於這個決定感到很痛心。安寧團隊向家人說明撤除的準備工作及可能遇到的症狀及過程，鼓勵家人多想多溝通。若之後要針對撤除開家庭會議，安寧團隊也可以過來協助。
