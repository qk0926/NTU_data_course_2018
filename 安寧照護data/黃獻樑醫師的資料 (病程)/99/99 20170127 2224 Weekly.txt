[Brief summary]
After admission, transnasal trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy was done on 2016/12/30. After the surgery, she was transferred to SICU for post-OP care. Patient was not yet extubated. Post-OP consciousness was M5. Thus, follow up CT was done, and revealed: much residual tumor, some post-OP bleeding, obstructive hydrocephalus. Emergent bilateral EVD insertion was done on 12/30. After the EVD insertion, patient remained E1M5Vt. All four limbs movement was noted. Currently still ETT under MV. Normonatremic diuresis was noted after the surgery. We kept I/O with IV fluid support. The EVD was removed on 1/9. Perfusion CT was followed on 1/11, which reported IVH and right occipital and temporal lobe hypodensity. We tried weaning but she didn't have enough ventilating power. Intermittent fever persisted while no infectious sign was observed. All cultures were negative till now. We kept hypothermia therapy for her body temporature control. On 1/17 the weaning parameter wasn't passed. We discussed with her family about future disposition, including tracheostomy long term care. Her family preferred withdrawal, which was part of her will, after discussion. We consulted family medicine hospice team for withdrawal. The withdrawal time was set on 2/3. On 1/27 left upper limb skin rash developed. Urticaria was likely. Antihistamine was given.
