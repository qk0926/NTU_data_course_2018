Brief Summary of this week    
[Treatment course]
    After the admission, mannitol was given intravenously for reducing brain edema. He felt better subsequently. He only complained of mild headache which he could tolerate. Further surgical intervention would be arranged next month. The treatment course was complicated with moderate dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and general weakness on January 19, 2017. Mannitol and methylprednisolone were given intravenously under the suspicion of brain edema. We will keep current management in the following days.
