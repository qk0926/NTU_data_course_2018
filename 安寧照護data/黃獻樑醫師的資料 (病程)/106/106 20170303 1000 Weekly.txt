Brief Summary of this week    
This week, his conscious level was stationary GCS: E1M2Vt. Brain stem reflex (corneal reflex, doll eye) were still diminished. Antibiotics were discontinuous and Mannitol were slowly tapered. High sympathetic activity and SVT were noted (HR180). Hence, Baclofen and Lorazepam were prescribed as well as Inderol for rate control. The patient was hemodynamic stable. CS was consulted and tracheostomy would be arranged on Saturday.
