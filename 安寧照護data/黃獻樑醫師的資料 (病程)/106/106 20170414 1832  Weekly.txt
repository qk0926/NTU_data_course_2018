Brief Summary of this week    
High fever was was noted on 4/8 without toxic sign. After    discussion with the patient's mother, she agreed with monitoring the fever pattern first with adequate chest care. The fever subsided since 4/10. Because of poor prognosis, the family wished not to take further life prolonging action to avoid patient suffering. There was no obvious interval change afterward. We administered intensive symptomatic treatment and assited with advanced care plan.
