Brief Summary of this week    
In this week, the frequency of repetitive spasm like trunk movement, with profound sweating increased. The care giver reported patient seems to have positive response to the question if he had headache. Thus we administered acetaminophen 1# Q6H and ibuprofen PRN. We'll monitor the response and adjusted accordingly.
