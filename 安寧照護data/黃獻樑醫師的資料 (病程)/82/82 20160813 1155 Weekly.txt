Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, his consciousness gradually improved. Previous diarrhea condition was still noted. Stool toxin of Clostridium difficle showed positive. Oral metronidazole was given since 8/12.  However turbid dialysate was noted on the next day. The dialysate showed much total nuclear cells; peritonitis was suspected. After contacted with nephrologist, antibiotic change to carbapenem was suggested. Keep peritoneal dialysis for drainage. Low grade fever improved. Respiratory ventilation mode was kept with SIMV mode. 

Problem Assessment Plan   
          
PAP 1 

Assessment 
still mild fever, turbid dialysate, abdominal pain
-> Mepem was added according nephrologist suggestion
-> consider add anti-fungus drugs (Diflucan?) if poor response to Mepem (following dialysate routine) according attending VS suggestion
-> hold weaning until infecion under control

Ganciclovir was hold due to CMV viral decreased

[Abx] 
Mepem for IAI (8/10-) D3
Oral Metronidazole (8/9-) stool C. difficule
---------------------------------------------------
Cefepime(7/22-7/24), Tazocin(7/21-7/22), Mepem (7/25-8/3)
Empirical Ceftazidime(8/4-8/10) 
Empirical Vancomycin(7/22-8/09) for suspected left sialadenitis
Ganciclovir (8/2-8/11) for CMV pneumonitis (sputum CMV viral load 8930 -> Broncho CMV < 150 cp
IP Cefazolin (8/10) empirically => Nephrologist suggest upgrade to carbapenem systemic using

[Ventilator settings]

[Culture]
7/19 PD dialysate: (-)
     right foot gangrene: Serratia marcescens 3+
     B/C(peri):(-)
7/21 B/C(peri):(-)
7/22 S/C: Normal mixed flora 
7/24 Vancomycin trough level: 13.69 (after loading 1g on 7/22)

7/31 Blood  CMV undetectable
7/31 Sputum CMV 8930 cp/ml  
7/31 Sputum PJP PCR(-)
8/4  Mump virus IgM(-), IgG(+)

[Important study findings]
7/27 CT: bilateral GGO and patches; DVT in left external iliac vein with left lower extremity swelling; pneumoperitonium, chronic pancreatitis

8/3 Gallium scan
Probable active infection at bilateral lungs and left parotid gland

[Consultations]
CV §õ¥ô¥ú: NSTEMI less likely, please correct underlying electrolytes imbalence, on-going infection, and fluid overload. Keep Plavix and Pletaal.
7/27 Plastic surgeon: right gangrentic foot was not likely the infection source. Amputation is not necessary at present. 
7/29 Nephrologist for PD titration; VS½²§»Ùy has visited this pateint => add Extraneal
8/3  ID ­J°û§°: Downgrade Mepem to Ceftazidime, consider bronchoscopy to obtain high quality sputum; Keep Vanco for suspecting left sialadenitis, check IgM/IgG mump Ab, clarify the etiology
8/4 Radologist: left parotid: infection, inflammation or obstruction 
8/4 ENT: if infection, abx one week is enough
8/4 Chest: suggest biopsy by broncoscopy to confirm CMV pneumonitis
8/6 Inform Dr. ªL¯\·ì for RCC transfer 
8/10 Nephro: check dialysate analysis and adminstrated antibiotic if TNC>100. (consider systemic Carbepenem)

[Family decision]
7/22 Two sons: DNR except drugs. No HD if not feasible.
               agree tapering inotrpic agents and adding sedative agents for dyspnea relief
7/23 Two sons: agreed terminal care
7/24 Two sons: agreed continatuing PD as long as the BP is feasible
7/25 his son: refuse amputation
7/27 informed his family about the current condition, including infection, pneumoperitonium and DVT; they accepted feeding since no obvious evidence of bowel perforation; they accept no using anti-coagulant for DVT due to bleeding tendency; his family preferred palliative care and terminal care
8/04 Explained the incoming transfer to RCC for weaning.
8/06 2nd son: if fail to extubation, by nature, no tracheostomy
8/08 2nd son: Agreed with RCC transfer, decided no tracheostomy, if cannot extubate then consider withdraw

[Important intervention]
7/28 NG feeding + PD
8/1 Galllium scan
8/4 try SIMV mode

Plan 
1. Keep mepem use for suspect IAI
  -> pursue dialysate culture result
  -> consider add anti-fungus (Diflucan) if poor response to Mepem, following Dialysate routine
  -> consider further image study if had peritoneal s/s
2. Dianeal LC Ultra 2.5% 2L *2, Dianeal LC Ultra 1.5% 2L
  => monitor ultrafiltration. Set dry weight 57kg.  
  => consult nephrologist for dialysate adjustment: ­Ë§l
3. Keep feeding; monitor if any new-onset peritoneal sign
  => switch to elemental diet becasue of diarrhea
  => Keep flagyl for long-term antibiotics using
  => add smecta and imolax (contact dietitian for diet suggestion)
4. Not add warfarin as CV doctor suggestion, but DVT tx?
5. hold weaning until infection under control
6. resume Fentanyl due to consciousness improving and abdominal pain was told
7. MAY Consult hospice for palliative combined care and possible withdrawal need after attempt of weaning
