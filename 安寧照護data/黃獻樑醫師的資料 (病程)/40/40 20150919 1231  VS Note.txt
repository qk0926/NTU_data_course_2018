46 y/o F

1. TB meningoencephalitis, under HERZ (2015/09/04-)
2. Accte hypoxic respiratory failure, cause to be determined, status post ETT+MV(2015/09/10-)
3. Small infarct in right basal ganglia

acute consicous change with profound shock last night
seizure? CVA? nosocomial infection?
newly persistent anterior lead ST elevation
no CK elevation

Suggest:

-> Her son has come to visit this patient in the depressed mood
-> neurologist evulate this patient and favored poor neurologic outcome
-> no respiratory drive, under ventilator full support, try to adjust ventilator setting
-> deep coma, pupil no light reflex
-> HR variability and temperate seems resume autotonicity
-> keep on antiTB medication
-> taper IV steroid for TB vasulitis
-> I have contacted her son in Indoneslia for discussing the disease status and grave neuroloic outcome in the morning of 9/11
