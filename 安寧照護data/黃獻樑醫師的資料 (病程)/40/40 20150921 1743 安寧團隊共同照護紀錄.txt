1. TB meningoencephalitis, under HERZ (2015/09/04-), complicated with acute increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure, cause to be determined, status post ETT+MV (2015/09/10-)
3. shock, favor neurogenic shock
4. diabetes incipidus, central type

She was admitted due to TB meningoencephalitis and a shock episode was noted on 9/10. Pupil reflex became absent on the next day. CT showed severe brain swelling and brain herniation. EEG showed no waveform. Neurologist suggested severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with poor neurological condition. 

We were consulted for evaluation of ventilator withdrawal.
Consciousness: drowsy
ECOG: 4
DNR(-)同意書  以用印尼文向兒子解釋及溝通 口頭同意DNR
Main decision maker: 兒子
Dying prepare: 兒子表示已了解狀況並同意撤除呼吸器

(Plan)

upward titration every 10 minutes) and lorazepam(begin with
a 2.5-10 mg IV bolus and repeat boluses every 15 minutes as
need)
  (5)Ventilator: Over 0-5 minutes, reduce FiO2 to room air
and PEEP to 0; proceed over 0-15 minutes to reduce the respiratory rate and tidal volume or target pressure on the ventilator to 0.
