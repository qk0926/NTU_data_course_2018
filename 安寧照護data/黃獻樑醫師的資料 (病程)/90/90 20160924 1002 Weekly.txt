Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, empirical Brosym was given for suspected pneumonia or CNS infection. Depakine was given for intermittent seizure while his oxygen demand decreased gradually. EEG on 2016/09/19 showed active regional epileptogenicity in the left frontocentral areas. Neurologists were consulted and Keppra was added. Family meeting was held on 2016/09/20 and poor prognosis was informed. His family still expressed they prefer aggrassive treatment. Intermittent seizure was still noted and EEG was repeated on 2016/09/22, which showed status epilepticus. The dossage of Keppra was titrated and Domicum pump was administered. Follow-up EEG on 2016/09/23 showed only intermittent slow waves. Domicum was then tapered off on 2016/09/24. 

Problem Assessment Plan   
          
PAP 1 
Assessment 
Following EEG on 9/22 still epileptic wave form according nurologist
-> increase keppra to 1500 q12H and add on dormicum pump according neurologist suggestion, following EEG tomorrow again, if still not subsided, consider transfer to NICU for 24hr EEG monitor
-> hold extubation plan due to persist seizure
-> f/u EEG 9/23
-> EEG improving according neurologist, suggested gradually tapper dormicum since tomorrow

[Images and special exams]
9/17 B+C+A+P CT: 
1. Leptomeningeal process with suspect brain metastasis.
2. Left lung cancer with lung, pleural and bone metastases.
3. Total consolidation and collapse of the left lung with large pleural effusion

9/19 EEG:
EEG reveals mild diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis in the left hemisphere, with active regional epileptogenicity in the left frontocentral areas. Advise clinical correlations. 

[Important internevtions]
09/17 ETT+MV

[Consultations]
9/19 Neurologist:
1. Check VPA drug level stat. May (1) up-titrate Depakine if inadequate drug level, or (2) Add-on second-line AED.
2. Pursue formal EEG report. Follow-up EEG study if still intermittent seizures.
3. Correct the metabolic derrangement, especially the electrolyte imbalance.

[Family's decisions]
09/20 family meeting and they prefer aggrasive treatment

Plan 
1. Keep Depakine + keppra + dormicum pump for persist seizure, tapper dormicum since tomorrow, may follow up EEG next W1 if need 
2. Keep Fentanyl for pain control
3. Hold extubation plan due to persist seizure
4. Emperical Brosym use for fever with left lung collapse, persue the culture data, complete 7 days course 
5. Inform the patient's family about poor prognosis
