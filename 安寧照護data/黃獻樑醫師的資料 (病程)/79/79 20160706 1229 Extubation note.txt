The family had decided withdraw. We had administered Buscopan and solucortef one hour earlier before extubation. Extubation was performed on 2016/07/06 12:00. The appearance was smooth with slightly tachypnea. Fentanyl pump was kept for tachypnea. There was no obvious wheezing or stridor after extubation.
