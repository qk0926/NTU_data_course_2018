Informant:the patient and the past medical record.
Intermittent fever up to 39"C for about two months. 
病史(Brief History) 
This is a 70-year-old man with the medical history of
1. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, stage IIE, status post R-CHOP
(IV) in 2012, complete remission, but recurrence in 2014, status post oral Endoxan and
Dorison (2015/2/12-2/16, 2015/4/2-4/6)status post Rituximab-Bendamustin(I)(C1D1=2015/6/2
)), status post Rituximab-Bendamustin(II)(C2D1=2015/7/23)
2. Chronic kidney disease
3. Bronchiectasis
4. Duodenal ulcer
5. Gouty arthritis
     According to the patient’s statement and medical record, The patient had increased sputum amount several months before April 2012. The patient denied fever/chills, dyspnea, or chest tightness during this period of time. He received a body check-up in 2012 and the chest X-ray showed a radiopaque mass at left lower lung. He underwent a chest CT on 2012/5/3 which showed bronchitis and bronchiolitis changes of bilateral lungs and a lung mass over left lower lung. The bronchoscopic biopsy was performed and the pathology showed degenerative bronchial epithelial cells. He received CT-guided biopsy on 2012/05/30 and the pathology report proved to be diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 
     He completed chemotherapy with R-CHOP (VI) and was in complete remission. He received regular OPD follow. However, he found bilateral mandibular masses since in the summer in 201 but masses usually resolved spontaneously. He also stated that masses were sometimes painful sensation. After few episodes of recurrence, the left mandibular mass became permanent with tenderness. He received PET scan on 2014/11/17 which revealed new intense hot areas at bilateral submandibular glands (R＞L), new mild spots at bilateral upper jugular node and more intense hypermetabolism at right retrotracheal to paratracheal, and subcarinal nodes. He received core needle biopsy to the left level IB lesion on 2015/1/9. The pathology report revealed malignant lymphoma involvement (B cell type) (IHC shows CK-, CD79a+, CD3-, EBV- and CD20+). The whole body CT in 2015/1 showed No obvious brain or skull tumor. No obvious neck mass or abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathies. He received oral Endoxan 50mg BID and Dorison 4mg BID from 2015/2/12 to 2015/2/16. He complained of mild oral ulcer, puffy face and Herpes zoster. He received Endoxan 50mg QD and Dorison 4mg QD from 2015/4/2 to 2015/4/6. But the left submandibular lympathopathies persisted. The following PET scan on 2015/5/18 showed mildly progressive changes of prior FDG-avid nodes at bilateral supraclavicular and mediastinal nodes, persistent at left submandibular node but regression at right submandibular node. Because the patient could not tolerate Endoxan and steroid, he was suggested receiving intravenous chemotherapy. On 2015/6/2, he was admitted for scheduled Rituximab-Bentamustine. He received Rituximab (375mg/m2) on 2015/6/2 and Bendamustin (150 mg/day) from 2015/6/3 to 2015/6/4. There was a little abdominal discomfort which he can't clearly described and bilateral blisters over thigh and legs noted after chemotherapy.
     He was admitted for 2nd cycle of Rituximab+ Bendamustine(C2D0=2015/7/23). After admission, Rituximab was given on (C2D0=2015/7/23),Bendamustin(cash) were given on D2 and D3(2015/7/24~2015/7/25) There was no specific discomfort noted after target therapy and chemotherapy. We consulted dermatologist for bilateral blisters over thigh and legs with itching sensation complained by patient. Bulloud pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis were suggested;therefore, we checked anti-BMZ Ab, anti-ICS Ab and arranged dermatology's OPD for biopsy. Under stable condition, patient was discharged on 2015/7/26 and we arranged OPD follow up.
     This time, intermittent fever up to nearly 39"C was noted during these two months, especially in the morning. Besides, chills, cough with whititsh sputum, mild dyspnea, body weight loss (52.5kg on 2015/07/26 and 45.6kg on 2015/11/13), poor appetite and general malaise were also noted during this period. He went to our ER once on 2015/09/17 for help due to chills, and fever up to 39.8"C was noted. Blood culture and urine culture both showed negative findings. After antibiotics: Maxipime and anti-viral medication: Valtrex use, fever was then subsidede. He was then regularly followed up at our OPD, but intermittent fever was still noted. Chest X-ray followed on 11/12 showed increased infiltrationts at bilateral lower lung fields. Tuberculosis infection or tumor fever were highly suspected. After discussing with the patient, admitted for further survey and treatment was suggested to the patient, and he approved. So he was admitted today. He also mentioned that he had left tongue ulcer painful for 3 monthsand was followed up at our ENT OPD. Scheduled left tongue ulcer biopsy would be arranged today, but due to suspect tuberculosis infection, scheduled left tongue ulcer biopsy arranged today was then hold. If acid fast stain and TB PCR showed negative, then we may consult the ENT doctor for left tongue ulcer biopsy.

Family History: His wife was diagnosed of lung cancer and was dead.
