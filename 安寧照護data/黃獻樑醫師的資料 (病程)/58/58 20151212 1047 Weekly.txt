[Important Patient and Family Decisions]
11/27 口頭說願意急洗腎，但之後拔管後不重插.

12/06 再次確認DNR時, 病人姐姐表示若還有機會, 緊急時仍希望插管, 在無法聯繫爸爸的情況下, 姐姐簽屬撤銷放棄急救, 重簽需插管但不壓不電不給急救藥物, 同時姐姐表示不願意接受氣切
Previous DNR(全拒) was signed by her father but was withdrawn by her older sister
DNR except intubation+MV
12/07 family decided DNR全拒不洗腎
12/08 Family could accept withdraw
12/09 family unable to decide withdraw timing, 捨不得

Plan 
1. Keep Zyvox for VRE bacteremia, may DC Mepem for complete course of HAP; pursue all culture results
2. keep MTP 10mg Q12H and Clexane 30mg QD for autoimmune activity
3. Best supportive care, give D50W for poor digestion status
