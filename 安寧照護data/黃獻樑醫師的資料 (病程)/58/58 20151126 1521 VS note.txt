Brief Summary of this week 
She had an fever episode on 11/23, however, chest-x-ray showed no specific finding. We upgraded antibiotic to ertapenem(11/23-11/25) due to previous U/C E.coli, ESBL. UA on 11/23 showed no pyuria. B/T on 11/23 1u, 11/24 1u and 11/25 1u was given due to anemia Hb:6.4. However, another fever up to 38.6C episode was noted on 11/26. Thus due to previous culture data, we shift antibiotic to ceftazidime (11/25-) to cover pseudomonas. X-ray on 11/26 showed improvement of bil. lung infiltration. We rechecked lab data Hb: 8.3, Na:147, Cr:5.8, CRP: 2.23, WBC: 7.24, seg 72.3. Hypernatremia and hemoconcentration due to dehydration was suspected so we DC Rasitol and give D5W 500c.c hydration since 11/26.

Plan 
for AKI:
-find etiology
-record I/O, BW
-Hold HD, give lasix 1amp Q12H IV
-f/u BUN/Cr/K/VBG/CXR
-consult Dr.½²©s©ø, no need of bx or adjustment immunosuppressant of drug was told 
- if stable, consider remove double lumen

for anemia:
- upper GI bleeding was ruled out, use current PPI

for hyperglycemia:
-educate diet control
-consult Àç¾i®v
-change to Diamicron 1tab BID

for bactermia:
-ertapenem
-remove bil. double lumen and obtain tip culture
