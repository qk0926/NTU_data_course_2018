Brief Summary of this week 
At ER, double lumen was insertion wtih emergent H/D was done on 11/7,11/9. After admission to 7B, H/D was hold and lasix 1 amp Q12H was given. Fluid restriction was performed. Orthopnea or DOE improved. We consulted ½²©s©øÂå®v, renal biopsy or immunosuppressant drug adjustment was not suggested. We checked urine, no dysmorphic RBC was found and GN was ruled out.Thus, AKI related to rejection, graft failure or heart failure was impressed. We follow up her BW, BUN,Cr, I/O, chest-x-ray frequently. Renal function and cardiomegaly improved.
Due to anemia, anesthetized PES was done on 11/16 and Reflux esophagitis,lower esophagus,LA:B and Superficial gastritis was impressed. PPI use was kept.
However, an episode of chills with dyspnea was noted on 11/17 night and 11/8 morning. Urosepsis(U/C:E.coli>100000, ESBL) or CRBSI was impressed. Ertapenem was used(11/18-11/20). Blood culture from R't double lumen and peripheral both grew GNB. Thus, R't and L't double lumen was removed on 11/18 and 11/19. Antibiotic was downgrade to Rocephin(11/20-) due to R't double lumen and peripheral both showed K.P. Due to sepsis episode,  Sirolimus and steroid was stopped since 11/20. Since Antibiotic was added, no fever or chills episode was noted.

<important consultation>
11/11 Dr.½²©s©ø:
resume immunosuppressant drugs if patient and family agree
titrate frequency of dialysis or even stop dialysis, if renal function stabilizes

<anti>
ertapenem (11/18-11/20)
Rocephine(11/20-)

Plan 
for AKI:
-find etiology
-record I/O, BW
-Hold HD, give lasix 1amp Q12H IV
-f/u BUN/Cr/K/VBG/CXR
-consult Dr.½²©s©ø, no need of bx or adjustment immunosuppressant of drug was told 
- if stable, consider remove double lumen

for anemia:
- upper GI bleeding was ruled out, use current PPI

for hyperglycemia:
-educate diet control
-consult Àç¾i®v
-change to Diamicron 1tab BID

for bactermia:
-ertapenem
-remove bil. double lumen and obtain tip culture
