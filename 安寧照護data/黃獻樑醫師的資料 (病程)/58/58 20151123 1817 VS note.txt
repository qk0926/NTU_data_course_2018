1.K. pneumoniease sepsis, suspect CRBSI, and ESBL E. coli bacteriuria
2.ESRD s/p kidney transplantation, CKD progress to stage 5, with AKI (suspect poor drug compliance with rejection, graft failure, or CRS), complicated with lung edema and axzotemia, s/p emergent HD on 7/10,11,13, hold HD now
3.Acute decompensated heart failure, with lung edema
4.SLE with kidney, lung, and CNS involvement
5.Anemia, GERD LA-B, suoperficial gastritis, gastric erosion
6.DM, HTN

both DLCs removed, culture: P. mirabilis and GNB
still low grade fever, bandemia (1.9%), CRP 4.32 improved
Azotemia staionary, F/U CXR: cardiomegaly, Lt pleural effusion
No strong eveidence of SLE activity (except high LDH and ESR)
=>
1.keep Rocephin for sepsis
2.increase lasix dose, F/U CXR, BUN/Cr/K/VBG W4, BW and I/O  (goal BW 58.5)
3.if sepsis improved, resume Rapamune and steroid
