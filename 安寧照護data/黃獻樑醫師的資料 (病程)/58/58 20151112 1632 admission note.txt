progressive leg edema, shortness of breath and orthopnea since Nov.4, 2015. 
病史(Brief History) 
■Present illness
  This 49 y/o woman has history of: 
1. SLE since 1994 with lupus nephritis, lung and central nervous system involvement, under plaquenil and prednisolone 
2. ESRD, s/p right pelvic cadaveric kidney trasplantation in 2005, with cellular rejection (baseline creatinine=3.6~4.5), acutely exacerbated and complicated with fluid overload and azotemia, status post emergent hemodialysis (2015/7/10, 7/11, 7/13) under Cellcept, Rapamune and Predonine control 
3. Acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema
4. Chronic anemia (baseline hemoglobin=6~8), iron and Vitamin B12 deficiency and chronic renal disease related, under Ferrum supplement
  The patient was diagnosed as SLE since 1994 and was regularly followed in 馬偕H. Her disease was complicated with lupus nephritis, CNS and lung involvement. Chronic kidney disease progressed to end-stage renal disease. She receive hemodialysis in 馬偕H. On Nov. 16, 2005, she received cadaveric kidney transplantation at our hospital. She was then under regular follow-up at Dr.蔡孟昆's OPD. During 2010 to 2012, deterioration of renal function was noted. Renal biopsy in Sep. 2011 showed borderline cellular rejection. In Aug.2012, she visited 署基H and then was transferred to our ER due to impaired renal function and metabolic acidosis(GAS: pH7.23, pCO=21.3, HCO3=4.4; BUN 117.5, Cr 11.9). Renal echo showed contracted native kidneys and mild hydronephrosis of graft kidney. Acute graft rejection or SLE flare-up was concerned. Temporary hemodialysis and Methyl-prednisolone 40mg q12h were started, and renal function improved afterwards. She was then discharged with OPD follow-up. Serum creatinine was around 2.5~3.5 during 2012 to 2013. She had multiple hospitalization experiences during 2012~2014 and on Feburary, 2015 once due to recurrent dyspnea, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, which was relieved by diuretics or temporary hemodialysis. 
  During July 10-24, 2015, she was admitted to our hospital due to fever, progressive lower limb edema, decrease in urine amount, and increase in body weight 6kg in 2 weeks. Black stool was mentioned under oral iron supplementation. Fever and hypoxemia with impending hypoxic respiratory failure were found at ER. Physical exam showed bilateral coarse crackles and bilateral lower limbs pitting edema 2+. CXR revealed perihilar increased lung infiltrates (r/o pulmonary edema) and no urine output even after iv diuretic administration. Lab data showed poorer renal function, liver function impairment, and ADHF (CK 189 U/L, CK-MB 20 U/L, Troponin I 1.03 ng/mL, pro-BNP >35000 pg/mL, ALT 157 U/L, BUN 75.8 mg/dL, CRE 5.2 mg/dL, Na 133 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Ca 2.14); moreover, mild metabolic acidosis (pH 7.401, PO2 44.9 , HCO3 19.7, BaseExcess -5.4, PCO2 31.4), severe anemia (Hb 5.3), and pyruia (U/A: WBC 20-35, Bact 4+) were discovered. Because of chronic renal failure with fluid overload, nephrologist was consulted for emergent hemodialysis. She was admitted to intensive care unit and accepted SLED, component therapy. Autoimmune marker was rechecked without level elevation. The patient still had poor renal function and small amount of urine output even under hemodailysis and diuretics pump. She had dry weight setting at 65kg, and UF 3kg/time. Poor liver function was also noted. HBsAg and Anti-HCV were both negative. The patient was under ceftazidime and then ceftriaxone. Blood culture showed 2 set of wild type Salmonella, sensitive to ceftazidime. Furosemide pump was switched to furosemide 80mg BID without fever or dyspnea. 
  This time, she had progressive legs edema since Nov.4,2015 but denied oliguria or large amount free water intake. On Nov.7,2015 early morning, she was borught to our ER due to acute shortness of breath and orthopnea. Hypotension (SBP: 80-90 mmHg) and hyperglycemia (474mg/dL) were noted. Her consciousness was alert (GCS: E4M5V3) with higher oxygen demend (SpO2: 99%, O2 10L/min 60%). Vital signs were:BP 142/62 PR 94/min RR 22/min BT 37.1. Lab data as follows: WBC 8.87 Seg 88 Hb 4.3 BUN 112.7 Cr 6.1 Na 133 K 5.3 ProBNP 31300 sugar 489, vein gas PH 7.40 pCO2 32 HCO3 20.5, OB:3+. On Nov.7, 2015, CXR showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. A+V IH and Rasitol 1amp Q8H was given. Nephrologist was consulted and double lumen was inserted with emergent Hemodialysis on Nov.7 and Nov.9. Renal echo was arranged showing: chronic parenchyml renal disease, graft kidney also chronic parenchymal renal disease and right renal cyst. EKG showed: normal sinus rhthmn. GI doctor was consulted but the family refused to take Panendoscope. 
  She was transferred to our ward on Nov.11,2015. This time, according to her sister, they do not live with the patient and they think maybe the patient's adherance to immunosuppressant drugs and SLE modulator was not regular. Recent common cough espisode was noted but no medication was taken. No nausea, vomiting, hematuria, proteinuria or bloody stool were noted at home. No any malar rash but only eczema-like rash was noted at right anterior leg. Thus, under the impression of acute on chronic kidney injury related to graft failure, immunosuppressant drug toxicity, glomerulonephritis or acute heart failure, she was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

Treatment Goal:
* A 49-year-old woman with lupus nephritis related end-stage renal disease s/p cadavar kidney transplantation with cellular rejection(baseline Cr 3.6-4.5) present with acute kidney injury, suspected related to glomerulonephritis, graft failure, immunosuppressant drug toxicity or acute heart failure.


S: dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and bil. lower leg edema
O: CXR showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion, ProBNP 31300 
P:1)use lasix to remove excess fluid, monitor I/O and BW, adjust 
    fluid status. 
  2)consider the necessity of hemodialysis
  3)consult Dr.蔡孟昆醫師 for immunosuppressant drug adjustment and 
    necessity for kidney re-biopsy 
  4)monitor Systemic lupus nephritis flare-up symtoms and keep    
    plaquenil and prednisolone treatment

S:anemia 
O: At ER, Hb:4.3 OB:3+
P:1)consult GI and arrange panendoscope
  2)B/T if needed
