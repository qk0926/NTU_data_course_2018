1.ESRD s/p kidney transplantation, with CKD, progress to stage 5, with AKI, complicated with lung edema and axzotemia, s/p emergent HD on 7/10,11,13, hold HD now
2.Acute decompensated heart failure, with lung edema
3.SLE with kidney, lung, and CNS involvement
4.Anemia, suspect GI bleeding
5.DM, HTN

Dyspnea improved, no lung edema
U/O (+) by lasix
Chest: bil. lower lung crackles, Lt>Rt
CXR: lung edema improved
AKI: suspect poor drug compliance with rejection, graft failure, or cardiorenal dynsrome
No strong eveidence of SLE activity (except high LDH and ESR)
E. coli bacteriuria, not on ABx yet

=>
1.keep lasix, F/U CXR, BUN/Cr/K/VBG, BW and I/O to decide further HD or not
2.resume immunosuprresant
3.EGD next W1
4.adjust OAD dose, watchout infection sign and SLE activity
