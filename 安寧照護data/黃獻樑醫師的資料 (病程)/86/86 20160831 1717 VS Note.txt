2016/08/30 照會 外科部(神經外科急診、緊急照會)陳敞牧主治醫師
1. Primary CNS lymphoma progression poor outcome high risk for surgery (VP shunt for hydrocephalus) 2. Consulted hema and onco RT for Primary CNS lymphoma evaluation. 3. Maybe consulting hospice care.

2016/08/29 照會 腫瘤醫學部(腫瘤醫學部(放射腫瘤科))蔡巧琳主治醫師
Although previous RT dose to whole brain had not reached the dose contraint, WBRT is too risky for the patient currently because the tumor rapidly progressed with prominent perifocal edema and compression of midbrain. We did not suggest brain RT. I have explained our concern to the patient's daughter. The patient's son will also went back to VGH for opinion on 8/30. We will discuss with the patient's son and RT doctors at VGH later. Thank you for your consultation. R3郭文涵52267 / VS蔡巧琳

今日與家屬會談, 告知病人狀況不佳, 可能無法化療與放療, 且醫師建議hospice care. 女兒與兒子持相反意見, 女兒希望hospice, 但兒子仍想積極治療. 希望再給他們討論空間. 告知目前無任何積極治療, mannitol和steroid長期使用皆可能有併發症, 家護病房住久亦有可能產生嚴重感染, 或是腫瘤無法控制壓迫腦幹種種可能. 家屬簽訂DNR.

Plan: 
1. DC Rocephin
2. informed his son of his possibility of sudden death
