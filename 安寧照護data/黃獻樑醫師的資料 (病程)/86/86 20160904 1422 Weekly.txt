[Images]
8/22 Brain CT:
 - Prominent hypodense change in bilateral brain, with midline shift to left about 0.6cm, and suspected right uncal herniation, brain tumor with prominent vasogenic edema?
 - Loss of gray-white matter differentiation at right temporooccipital lobe, recent infarction cannot be excluded. 
 - Hydrocephalus. 
8/22 CXR: increased bil infiltration, mild haziness at right upper lung zone
8/26 Brain CT: Diffuse brain swelling, hydrocephalus, masses at right basal ganglia-thalamus to brainstem. Recurrent tumors and CSF seeding are considered.

[Important family decision]
- Family favor DNR, except elder son (live with patient) -aggresive treatment, would consider tracheostomy
- want transfer to 北榮 -> no ICU bed 
(二女兒 ask us to follow DNR if cardiac arrest, and she would signed the permit -> not suitable?)
- 09/03 兒子希望腫瘤科醫師說明腫瘤現況與治療之可能

[Important consultation]
8/22 contact NS duty Dr.何 -> mannitol is indicated
     Contact CV duty Dr. 黃--> no RWMA under echocardiography
8/25 照會 血液腫瘤科 黃泰中主治醫師, 建議事項 1. Please give betamethasone 8mg IV Q8H for 48-72 hours; DC if no signs of improvement of his respiratory pattern or other IICP signs.
8/29 照會 腫瘤醫學部(放射腫瘤科) 郭文涵住院醫師/VS蔡巧琳, 建議事項 WBRT is too risky for the patient currently because the tumor rapidly progressed with prominent perifocal edema and compression of midbrain. We did not suggest brain RT.

Plan 
1. Keep current mannitol and Cortisone dosage
2. Keep cash Nexium
3. poor prognosis and high risk for sudden cardiac arrest were informed
4. contact hematologist on 09/05, for explaination of cancer status and possible treatment
