Brief Summary of this week    
[4C1 2016/03/18-]
After transferred to RCC, tachypnea (RR>35), tachycardia and desaturation (SpO2:88% under FiO2:35%) with accessory muscle use was noticed at night. Therefore, ventilator was shifted back to PC/AC. The chest tube was removed due to poor drainaged amount on 2016/03/22. Maxipime was kept for a 21 days course and was DC on 2016/4/1. There was no more fever episodes. The patient's family (his smallest son) still hestated about withdraw and couldn't contact other brothers and sisters. Therefore, we kept weaning program as possible. But intermittent tachypnea with decline saturation were noticed, therefore, we hold weaning and shifted to PCV mode again. We also contact social worker for the patient's family support problem. After longterm discussion, the smallest son and the smallest daughter signed withdrae permission and ventilator withdraw was performed on 2016/4/12. There was no acute stridor but much sputum was noted. Under relatively stable condition, he was transferred to general ward for further care. 


Assessment 
<Abx> 
Nil now

IH Amikacin (3/15-24) -> S/C: PsA, CT: bronchiectasis
Ceftazidime (3/7-3/12) -> Empyema C: KP and S/C of PsA
Tazocin  (2/26-3/7) --> HCAP and empyema
Metronidazole (3/5-3/7) ->better coverage of anerobic pathogen

<Culture report>
3/3  pleural effusions/C:wild KP
3/4  S/C:wild PSA, wild KP
3/15 S/C:wild PSA
         AB(R to Gentamicin)

<Nutrition>  
纖維配方, 濃度:1 卡/cc熱量:1500 營養品:健力體

<Important intervention and newly added medications>
3/03 Respiratory acidosis --> on BiPAP
3/03 Desaturation --> ETT+MV 
     (原本考慮不插管,但經說明手術治療膿胸可能改善,決定插管); 
     right thoracentesis (turbid pleural effusion) 
     --> change to chest tube
3/04 Transfer to 3A2 MICU;
     chest tube revision and drained 400mL pus
     --> CS: not indicated for decortication now, 
     suggest keep chest tube drainage
3/05 Add Anegyn for better coverage of anaerobic pathogen
3/06 PCV-> PSV
3/07 Shift Abx to Tatumcef for empyema culture of 
     wild type KP and S/C of wild type PsA
3/08 PS 8, RR 35 in the evening
3/09 SBT borderline
3/09 WP: -48/+60, RSBI 136 (Vt 242, MV 8.0) 
     TP 1h, accessory muscle use and RR 30-35
3/10 Urokinase(I); left thoracocentesis 
     (poor gliding of left lung)
3/11 Urokinase(II)
3/12 Chest tube connection to negative pressure 10;
     shift Tatumcef to Maxipime for increasing lung 
     infiltrates
3/14 Off Chest tube connection to negative pressure
3/15 Add IH amikacin
3/16-17 TP 1h ok
3/17 Low tidal volume and tachypnea. PS 10->14 
     Hold extubation
3/18 Transferred to RCC
3/19 Intermittent tachypnea s/p 0.5 amp Anxicam
     alpraline 0.5#Q12H
3/21 DC alpraline for poor consciousness
     Give withdrawal permit to his son 
3/22 Remove chest tube
3/23 Add Ultracet for pain control
3/24 Waiting for withdrawal permit. DC IH Amikacin
3/28 Social worker visited
4/11 Cuff leak test: inadequate
4/12 extubated, poor airway clearance

<Important consultation>
03/04 CS: for empyema; arrange chest CECT
--> favor medical treatment first due to mild improvement of CXR; consider VATS if poor improvement
03/07 CS 曾穎凡/徐紹勛: VATS and Urokinase are probably not needed for the current condition

<Important patient's and family's decision>
02/26 DNR 全拒
03/03 決定接受手術，故同意插管
03/09 兒子決定拔管不重插
3/31
the patient's third daughter come and still hestate about withdraw decision after well discussed with the patient's smallest son
-> well explaint the possible choice plan (according attending VS suggestion): 
1. consider long term care (consider tracheostomy or not) then transfer to RCW
2. consider withdraw then extubation
4/1 小兒子:prefer withdrawal
    三女兒:prefer RCW transfer
4/2 小兒子:ETT withdrawal on 4/12
    三女兒:respect the decision of youngest son
4/6 小兒子: ETT withdrawal on 4/12

Plan 
. since poor airway clearance and CO2 retension noted, inform his son the possibility of sudden respiratiory collapse; not suitable for BiPAP due to lots of sputum production; consistent on DNR and hospice care

. Abx free
. Give inhalation mucolytic agents
  wait for transfer
. Keep 健力體 (higher protein, moderate sugar) and close monitor CO2 (hypoglycemia using 益肺佳)
