[15B]
After admission, we kept empiric Tazocin. Sputum culture grew mixed flora. We tapered O2 therapy from mask to cannula due to fair SpO2. No fever was noted but CXR revealed RLL consolidation and pleural effusion in progression. Blood gas showed acute respiratory acidosis and BiPAP was applied due to "Do not intubate" decision. Bedside echo showed massive complicated right pleural effusion and thoracentesis yielded purulent content. Analysis favored empyema and chest tube was inserted. However, poor drainage function was noted despite acceptable position by CXR. We consulted CS and surgical intervention was decided after informing high surgical risk due to elder age and poor performance status. Desaturation developed at night, so he received intubation on 3/3. He was transferred to ICU on the next day.

[3A2]
After transferred to 3A2 on 2016/03/04, CT showed the right chest tube not in pleural space. We removed the chest tube and created a path for a new 28Fr chest tube. Upon entry, about 500mL of pus was drained. It was sent for analysis. The result was compatible with empyema. The Gram stain was negative.
