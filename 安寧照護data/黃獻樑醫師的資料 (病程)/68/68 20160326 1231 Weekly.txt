This 88-year-old man with:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure, pneumonia and empyema related, s/p ETT-MV (2016/03/03-)
2. Empyema, right, s/p chest tube drainage (2016/03/03-)
3. Bronchiectasis-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (2016/03/04 CT)
4. Dementia
5. Right hip fracture, s/p open reduction internal fixation (2016/01/20)
6. Status post subtotal gastrectomy (details not avaliable)
7. Cataract, status post operation

[Treatment course] : see treatment course note
[15B 2016/03/02~3/04]
[3A2 2016/03/04~3/18]

[4C1 2016/03/18~]
After transferred to RCC, tachypnea (RR>35), tachycardia and desaturation (SpO2:88% under FiO2:35%) with accessory muscle use was noticed at night. Therefore, ventilator was shifted back to PC/AC and increase FiO2 to 50%. And the condition improving after sedation drugs use. The chest tube was removed due to poor drainaged amount on 2016/03/22. The patient's family (his smallest son) still hestated about withdraw and couldn't contact other brothers and sisters. Therefore, we keep antibiotics treatment and weaning program as possible.

[Assessment]
Under Cefepime D15 (3/12~) for lung pneumonia with empyema

No fever
alert conscious, but can't obey order
intermittent agitation with tachycardia and tachypnea, no decline saturation this morning
--> due to DC Ultracet? try low dose alpraline first
--> pending the patient's decision and withdraw permit
--> contact social worker next W1

[MV setting]
PSV PS:8, PEEP: 6, FiO2:35%, Ti:0.9
-> Vt: 300~400, Mv: 5.5~6.0, SpO2: 91-98%
 
[Important Study findings]
03/03 AM, VBG 7.250/61.7/61.6/27.3/-0.2 --> BiPAP
03/03 CXR: right pleural effusion
03/03 Pleural effusion: Glu <10, TP 4.5, LDH 9614, TNC 22152, N 100 (c/w empyema)
03/04 Chest CT: chest tube not in pleural space
03/04 Pleural effusion: TNC 111674 (L:N=1:99), LDH=16970, Glucose<10
03/06 Alb=1.8
03/19 tachypnea with desaturation -> shift back to PCV

[Important Intervention and Newly Added Medications]
03/03 Respiratory acidosis --> on BiPAP
03/03 Desaturation --> ETT+MV (原本考慮不插管,但經說明手術治療膿胸可能改善,決定插管); right thoracentesis (turbid pleural effusion) --> change to chest tube
03/04 Transfer to 3A2 MICU; chest tube revision and drained 400mL pus
--> CS: not indicated for decortication now, suggest keep chest tube drainage
03/05 Add Anegyn for better coverage of anaerobic pathogen
03/06 PCV-> PSV
03/07 Shift Abx to Tatumcef for empyema culture of wild type KP and S/C of wild type PsA
03/08 PS 8, RR 35 in the evening
03/09 SBT borderline
03/09 WP: -48/+60, RSBI 136 (Vt 242, MV 8.0) 
03/09 TP 1h, accessory muscle use and RR 30-35
03/10 Urokinase(I); left thoracocentesis (poor gliding of left lung)
03/11 Urokinase(II)

[Important Consultation]
03/04 CS: for empyema; arrange chest CECT
--> favor medical treatment first due to mild improvement of CXR; consider VATS if poor improvement
03/07 CS 曾穎凡/徐紹勛: VATS and Urokinase are probably not needed for the current condition

[Important Family’s Decisions]
02/26 DNR 全拒
03/03 決定接受手術，故同意插管
03/09 兒子決定拔管不重插

[Plans]
1. Keep cefepime and IH amikacin use for pneumonia and empyema, complete amikacin 10 days treatment course and cefepime 21 days treatment course if sepsis under control
2. keep CPAP support, noticed the hemodynamic status, keep weaning as possible
3. add ultracet for pain control
4. keep rehab as possible
5. Keep 健力體 (higher protein, moderate sugar) and close monitor CO2 (hypoglycemia using 益肺佳)
6. 拔管不重插, key person: his smallest sonson師之前有聯絡外科醫師表示暫不需要開刀,而病人目前並不符合拔管的條件,如果要拔管是要討論撤除維生醫療(病人有可能因此離開) -> 家屬表示理解暫先維持目前的治療
