Brief Summary of this week    
[4C1 2016/03/18-]
After transferred to RCC, tachypnea (RR>35), tachycardia and desaturation (SpO2:88% under FiO2:35%) with accessory muscle use was noticed at night. Therefore, ventilator was shifted back to PC/AC. The chest tube was removed due to poor drainaged amount on 2016/03/22. Maxipime was kept for a 21 days course and was DC on 2016/4/1. There was no more fever episodes. The patient's family (his smallest son) still hestated about withdraw and couldn't contact other brothers and sisters. Therefore, we kept weaning program as possible. But intermittent tachypnea with decline saturation were noticed, therefore, we hold weaning and shifted to PCV mode again. We also contact social worker for the patient's family support problem. After longterm discussion, the smallest son and the smallest daughter signed withdrae permission and ventilator withdraw will be performed on 2016/4/12.

RCC (3/18-)

<Abx> 
Nil now
---------------------------------------------------------
Cefepime (3/12-4/1) for lung pneumonia with empyema(KP; S/C:KP, PSA)
IH Amikacin (3/15-24) -> S/C: PsA, CT: bronchiectasis
Ceftazidime (3/7-3/12) -> Empyema C: KP and S/C of PsA
Tazocin  (2/26-3/7) --> HCAP and empyema

3/15 S/C:wild PSA
         AB(R to Gentamicin)

纖維配方, 濃度:1 卡/cc熱量:1500 營養品:健力體

<Ventilator Setting>
PCV, IP 14, rate 12, PEEP 6, Ti 0.9, FiO2 30%
-> Vt: 300, RR 21, Mv: 6.4, SpO2: 97-99%

<Important Lab findings>
03/03 AM, VBG 7.250/61.7/61.6/27.3/-0.2 --> BiPAP

03/04 Chest CT: chest tube not in pleural space
03/19 tachypnea with desaturation -> shift back to PCV

<Important image and study findings>

<Important intervention and newly added medications>
03/03 Respiratory acidosis --> on BiPAP
03/03 Desaturation --> ETT+MV (原本考慮不插管,但經說明手術治療膿胸可能改善,決定插管); right thoracentesis (turbid pleural effusion) --> change to chest tube
03/04 Transfer to 3A2 MICU; chest tube revision and drained 400mL pus
--> CS: not indicated for decortication now, suggest keep chest tube drainage
03/05 Add Anegyn for better coverage of anaerobic pathogen
03/06 PCV-> PSV
03/07 Shift Abx to Tatumcef for empyema culture of wild type KP and S/C of wild type PsA
03/08 PS 8, RR 35 in the evening
03/09 SBT borderline
03/09 WP: -48/+60, RSBI 136 (Vt 242, MV 8.0)

03/10 Urokinase(I); left thoracocentesis (poor gliding of left lung)
03/11 Urokinase(II)

<Important consultation>
03/04 CS: for empyema; arrange chest CECT
--> favor medical treatment first due to mild improvement of CXR; consider VATS if poor improvement
03/07 CS 曾穎凡/徐紹勛: VATS and Urokinase are probably not needed for the current condition

<Important patient's and family's decision>
02/26 DNR 全拒
03/03 決定接受手術，故同意插管
03/09 兒子決定拔管不重插
3/31
the patient's third daughter come and still hestate about withdraw decision after well discussed with the patient's smallest son
-> well explaint the possible choice plan (according attending VS suggestion): 
1. consider long term care (consider tracheostomy or not) then transfer to RCW
2. consider withdraw then extubation
4/1 小兒子:prefer withdrawal
    三女兒:prefer RCW transfer
4/2 小兒子:ETT withdrawal on 4/12
    三女兒:respect the decision of youngest son
4/6 小兒子: ETT withdrawal on 4/12

Plan 
1. Abx free
2. keep PCV support
   小兒子: ETT withdrawal on 4/12
   Morphine for dyspnea after withdrawal
3. Keep 健力體 (higher protein, moderate sugar) and close monitor CO2 (hypoglycemia using 益肺佳)
