[Active]
1. Japanese viencephalitis with respiratory failure, status post intubation and mechanical ventilation since 2017/07/08; status post Solu-Medrol pulse (750mg/day)(2017/07/11-17) and IVIg (2g/kg)(2017/07/13-17)
[Inactive]
2. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, improved
3. Leukopenia, suspected viral infection related or Tazocin related, improved
4. Pneumonia, on Tazocin and then Maxipime (7/13-26), resolved

[Treatment course]
    On admission, he was E1VTM1, only OCR (+). Solu-Medrol pulse (750mg/day)(2017/07/11-17) and IVIg (2g/kg)(2017/07/13-17) were given. Oral prednisolone was given and tapered slowly. His neurological condition remained stationary. OCR became undectable but light reflex seemed to become trace. Following brain CT on 7/17 showed hypodensity at bilateral thalamus, medial temporal lobes and midbrain, a 0.7cm ICH at right thalamus, compatible with Japanese encephalitis. The repeated data sent to CDC showed positive IgM and negative IgG of Japanese encephalitis in both serum and CSF. Japanese encephalitis was comfirmed.
    Pneumonia got controlled with Maxipime. However, d-dimer and FDP increased with slightly lowering fibrinogen. DIC was suspected, though no definite cause was found. 
    EEG on 7/20 showed continuous generalized of diffuse slow waves at 3-6 Hz, 10-50uV, scattered triphasic sharp waves. Moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction.
    He developed polyuria and negative I/O, resulting in weight loss from 61 to 56 kg during ICU stay. Na level gradually declined. Either cerebral salt wasting or central DI was partly compatible. In the following week, his weight and I/O stablized. D-dimer remained around 8-11. EEg on 7/26 showed nearly continuous diffuse or generalized slow waves at 2-5 Hz, 40-100 uV.
    Fever developed on 7/31, and subsided on 8/1. Procalcitonin was low. Family meeting was arranged on 8/2 and they decided to have witdrawal on 8/9. Fever was noted once again on 8/4, and subsided after antipyretics use. Lab data followed showed elevated ALT level. HBV and HCV checked on 8/4 showed negative finding. Hospice was consulted for further plans. We will keep observing and current plans.
