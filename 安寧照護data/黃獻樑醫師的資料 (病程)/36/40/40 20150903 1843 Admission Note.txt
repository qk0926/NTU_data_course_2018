Dizziness and consciousness disturbance since 8/25 
病史(Brief History) 
[Present illness]
  This 46-year-old woman, previously healthy, has been a caregiver(看護) from Indonesia for about two years. She has been monogamous with her husband and denied intravenous drug use. She has been generally well and the latest health examination on 8/21 showed all negative results.
  She started to experience dizziness since 8/25 and some medications were prescribed with no effect. Hypersomnia and fever were noted by her employer and she was taken to 松山 Hospital\.  However, consciousness disturbance worsened that it was difficult to wake her up, and she was admitted to ER at 博仁 Hospital. On arrival at ER, GCS:E3MV1, T/P/R:38.7/121/18 BP: 175/101 mmHg were recorded. Blood tests showed leukocytosis.A diagnosis of CNS infection was made and vancomycin and ceftriaxone administered. Non-contrast brain CT on 9/1 showed diffuse brain swelling, especially at the cerebral cortex. One small hypodense nodule was noted at the right frontal subcortical white matter. Lumbar puncture was performed on the same day, which showed an opening pressure: 20cm H2O, pleocytosis(WBC:200, Lym:79.6%, Neu 17.9) and low level of glucose: 12 mg/dL. Blood test showed hepatitis(AST:94, ALT:104) and abdominal sonography disclosed 1. suspect chronic parenchymal liver disease, 2. Gall sludge, 3. Mild right hydronephrosis. We added Acyclovir for virus coverage. On 9/2, the brain MRI, which showed gyral swelling and increased T2 SI on FLAIR are also noted around right Sylvian fissure, with one ovoid T2 high SI nodule 1.2 x 0.7cm at the right frontal subcortical white matter, may be early encephalitis. The results were negative for HBV, HCV, VDRL but postive for anti-HIV(ELISA) test. She was  transferred to our hospital.
