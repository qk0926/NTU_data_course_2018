Suggest:

-> I have discussed the issue of end-of-life care and withdrawal of life suport to her son
-> consult palliative care team
-> neurologist evulate this patient and favored poor neurologic outcome
-> no respiratory drive, under ventilator full support, try to adjust ventilator setting
-> deep coma, pupil no light reflex
-> keep on antiTB medication
-> taper IV steroid for TB vasulitis
