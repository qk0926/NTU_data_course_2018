Dear Dr.:

  She had cough and dyspnea for 2 datys then OHCA s/p CPCR. ACKD with anuria was noted and she started H/D on 10/11. Unstable BP was noted during H/D and fluctuation BT was noted. HEr 3rd day EEG on 10/12 showed Iso-electric. There was no gag reflex. Family requested for withdraw of life support and we are consulted for hospice care. 
  小兒子表示原來三位小孩都在國外，近兩年病人狀況變差，小兒子便回台協助父親照顧。病人平常共病多, 先生照顧相當吃力, 且先生認為病人因為Parkinsonism末期，已經受了太多苦，很不忍心。現在家人都知道病人醒來的機率不高，也覺得這樣子沒有品質可言，因此考慮撤除；星期四早上10:30會與1A1原團隊開家庭會議討論決定。
