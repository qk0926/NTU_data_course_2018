Brief Summary of this week    
<10/13-10/17>
The patient was transferred to 4C1 from 6E1 on 10/13. The patient was intermittently agitated and sedation needed for better cooperation with ventilator use. Antibiotic treatment was kept. Family meeting was done on 10/15 and family felt hard to extubate or choose tracheostomy and current prolonged intubation was kept. Antibiotic treatment was kept for pulmonary infection and sedatives were kept. ID specialist was consulted for increased Aspergillus antigen raising up to 1.5, and oral Voriconazole was given for suspected recurrent pulmonary aspergillosis. However, breakthrough fever was noticed on 10/15 with hypotension later found. Septic workup was done with antibiotic was titrated up to Tigecycline. Critical condition had been explained to the family. Supportive care was kept. Further supportive care with mechanical ventilation and antibiotic treatment would be kept.

PAP4
Assessment 
09/23 CV VS陳盈憲: Coumadin was used instead of NOAC because there was a definite marker (INR) to monitor its effect; NOAC is not suitable for patients with renal insufficiency; Coumadin could be DC because of persistent hemoptysis
09/23 ID VS盤松青: 6-month treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis is sufficient, and this event is not compatible with the natural course (too acute); suggest to add Vfend if further culture evidence or high Aspergillus Ag titer
09/24 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: favor MGUS, check "bone survey" if his condition is tolerable; bone marrow study is considered
09/28 CV Fellow 許容綺: VPC bigeminy can be treated with Cordarone or Lidocaine if unstable hemodynamics; increasing Rytmonorm dosage is not recommended because it would cause bradycardia
09/29 CV VS陳盈憲: Rytmonorm could be DC, keep Cordarone for VPCs, but could be DC as well if Afib with MVR
09/30 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: lab data and PB smear showed no evidence of hemolysis
09/30 CV VS陳盈憲: DC Cordarone if drug-related abnormal liver function is suspected; do not add back digoxin due to drug-drug interaction with cordarone; if afib with RVR/VT with unstable hemodynamics, add back cordarone 0.5PC QD and slowly increase dosage
09/30 Radiologist 梁博欽: elective TAE will be arranged on 10/01
10/6 ID 洪: Since Enterobacter pneumonia in progression with Stenotrophomonas, may shift antibiotics to Cravit and sevatrim for combination use. Pending for fungus culture of bronchial washing. For Aspergillosis and NTM are also possible pathogens.
10/15 ID盛/盤: increased aspergilus ag (from ~0.8 to 1.5), previous CT 10/06 showed enlarged cavitation on RUL and necrotic mass, recent hemptysis, prolonged PNA, suggested add back Oral Vfend for suspected recurrent Aspergillosis

PAP5
Assessment 
09/23 Family: no CPCR; hesitated tracheostomy and TAE (if massive hemoptysis)
09/24 Family: agreed with TAE if massive hemoptysis; agreed tracheostomy (已給衛教單張及看影片介紹); didn't favor right pneumonectomy
09/25 Family: agreed with bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy next week
09/29 Family: agreed with bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy postponed to 09/30
10/01 TAE to right bronchial artery
10/05 due to deteriorating PNA, his family want to sign DNR if critical
10/09 Family meeting
10/15 家人仍無法決定是否撤除, 但病人不希望氣切, 目前情況仍不適合拔管, 仍想持續治療肺炎再觀察是否有機會拔管(拔管評估過)(但也偏向不重插)
