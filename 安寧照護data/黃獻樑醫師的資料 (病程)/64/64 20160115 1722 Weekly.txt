Brief Summary of this week    
During this week, he was admitted to PM&R ward on 2016/1/12. We started swallowing trainig with ¨ï¸H¦¨ªdÀ\ on 2016/1/13. He had no cholking after drinking milk or ³½´ö. Therefore, we removed NG tube on 2016/1/14 and gave him ¨ï¸HÀ\. However, drooling would be noted when he eat ¨ï¸HÀ\, but there was no cholking. Besides, he would hold ÃÄ¯»(ªw¤ô) for a time, which made him mildly cough. During the period of swallowing training, PE revealed bilateral clear breathing sound. As for PT/OT training, he started to practice walker with LLE prosthesis. 
  But, today, we noticed there was pus-like discharge from right 3rd toe, which may indicate progression of his PAOD in his right leg. Hence, we consulted Dr. ¬ö¤D·s today(pending his reply) and arranged vascular sonography on 2016/1/19 for further survey and managements. Also, we shifted Bokey(100mg/cap), 1#, QD + Plavix (75 mg/tab), 1#, QD to pletaal 1# QD + Plavix (75 mg/tab) for improving ischemic pain.
