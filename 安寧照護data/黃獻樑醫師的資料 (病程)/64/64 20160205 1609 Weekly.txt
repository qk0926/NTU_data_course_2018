Brief Summary of this week    
The patient had three episodes of stroke in recent one month. The latest one was at 2/1 night. He also had occult infection, suggested IAI by abdomen CT on 1/31. Mepem (1/31~) was used for better coverage of ESBL. After admission to 4E2 on 2/2, he was stupor with right hemiparesis. Bedside echo revealed mild ascites with mild liver cirrhosis. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly, without obvious pneumonia patch. U/A was clear. EKG revealed episodes of Afib RVR, PSVT, sinus tachycardia with premature supraventricular rhythm. Lab data revealed progressive leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, increasing cardiac enzymes (without evidence of CAD) and deteriorating renal failure. High fever started since 2/3. Targocid(2/3~) was added due to previous wound culture of GPC. He had episodes of air hunger and also seizure-like movement(»øª½.«r¯}¦ÞÀY). Follow up brain CT revealed stationary ischemic stroke as compared with 2/1.
Due to poor consciousness and sepsis with multiple organ failure, the family decided DNR(¥þ©Ú°|«Å,©Ú¬~µÇ). We provided best supportive care with: antibiotics, albumin/ blood transfusion(keep I/O balance), morphine(for dyspnea), anxicam(for seizure), verapamil(for rate control).
** The cause of sepsis may be due to ischemic bowels, considering his poor cardiovascular condition. However, he could not tolerate contrast-CT or explore laparotomy at this stage. 

Assessment 
1. Air hunger, episodes of SOB, using accessory muscles of neck and bilateral shoulder.
Lactic acid: 5.07
HCO3 14.5-> 11.7-> 10.9 
CO2 23.0-> 21.1-> 21.3
pH 7.404-> 7.350-> 7.312
BE -10.5 -14.1 -15.6 
CXR: stationary,  no obvious pneumonia patch, mild cardiomegaly
Breathing sound: prominent wheezing. (¤w§ÙµÒ20y,no COPD history).
>>>> Severe metabolic acidosis, with respiratory compensation, r/o sepsis -> Add Targocid to cover GPC.
>>>> Newly onset wheezing, r/o cardiac wheezes -> Inhalation therapy and Steroid(iv) with PPI(iv)

2. Seizure like episodes 4 times this day. «r¦ÞÀY+Âù¤â»øª½+ÂùªÓ¤@°}°}§Ý°Ê(consciousness unclear).
Emergent brain CT: stationary, no ICH.
Lab data: no electrolytes imbalance, ammonia 15, progressive kidney failure.
>>>> Effort breathing with dystonia or seizure (due to stroke or impaired renal falure)? -> Anxicam use was suggested by neurologist due to palliative nature. Hold AED due to weak evidence and adverse effects of liver/kidney (Half dose of Keppra could be consider).
 
3. Heart failure, with an episode of PSVT (HR 160+) in the afternoon.
pro-BNP >35000
Trop I: 0.371-> 0.413-> 0.456 -> 0.514
CK, CK-MB: not elevated
EKG: arrythmia (sinus tachycardia with premature supraventricular rhythm, PSVT, Afib), no ST-T change.
>>>> Elevated Trop I may be due to ACKD and heart failure -> check cardiac enzyme+EKG Q6H and pursue Holter report.

4. Renal failure
Proteinuria 3+
UN: 33.5-> 38.7-> 47.9-> 59.2 
CRE: 3.1-> 3.6-> 4.0-> 4.6 
U/O decreasing
>>>> ACKD, r/o nephrotic syndrom or sepsis related. 
->family denied hemodialysis.

5. Sepsis, r/o bacteria translocation from GI tract
WBC 11.74-> 12.06-> 13.35
Abdominal/Pelvis CT on 1/31, showing suspectious fat stranding in the upper abdomen, r/o peritontiis.
>>>> However, he could not tolerate contrast-CT or explore laparotomy at this stage.

Plan 
** 2/6©â¦åfor prognosis and correctable factors (best supportive care).
1. Mepem(1/31~)+ Targocid(2/3~)
2. Record I/O, keep I/O balance. Blood transfusion, Albumin, and Rasitol (iv) 20mg TID.
3. Anxicam use was suggested by neurologist due to palliative nature. Hold AED due to weak evidence and adverse effects of liver/kidney (Half dose of Keppra could be consider).
4. Titrate morphine use to anti-dyspnea.
5. Titrate Verapamil for rate control.
6. DNR¥þ©Ú°|«Å as discussed with wife, son and daughter. They clearly refuse H/D or intubation, and preferred palliative care.
