Brief Summary of this week    
After transfer to CCU, BiPAP support was given for pulmonary edema. Levophed infusion and Dopamine infusion was given for septic shock and acute decompensated heart failure. Predonine 2# BID was titrated to 3# BID for adrenal insufficiency. Ceftazidime was changed to Meropenem for coverage of resistant strains. Echocardiography revealed vegetation with intact mitral valve structure. CVS was consulted, and surgical management may be indicated if no other infectious focus.  Tachycardia to 150-160 bpm, was found, and EKG revealed AfRVR. Dopamine was stopped. Cordarone loading dose was given, and tachycardia had mild improvement. Thyrotoxicosis was suspected, with FT4 1.78 ng/dL, TSH 0.052 μIU/mL. Cordarone was stopped, and digoxin was kept. Levophed was stopped gradually. Recurrent fever with suspected new RLL patches was found on 2016/5/11. Meropenem was changed to Cravit for atypical pathogens coverage. Recurrent narrow QRS tachycardia to 150-160 bpm, was found. EKG revealed atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Tachycardia persisted despite Herbesser, Cordarone, and Digoxin loading dose infusion. Maintenance cordarone infusion, 0.3 mg/min, was started at night. Intermittent BiPAP use was given for tachypnea and desaturation. Thyroid storm was suspected due to fever, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and jaundice. Endocrinologist was consulted, and bed-side thyroid sonography revealed thyroid nodule, and relative hypoechoic thyroid gland. Thyrotoxicosis, r/o thyroid storm, was suspected, and PTU 100mg TID was added. Predonine 3# BID was changed to solu-cortef 50mg Q8H for better absorption and block of peripheral T3 conversion. Plugged liver biopsy was performed smoothly on 2016/5/13. Progression of thyroid dysfunction was found, with FT4 2.20 ng/dL, TSH 0.022 μIU/mL. Delirium developed with bizarre delusion. Tachycardia was persisted.  Endocrinologist was consulted, and dilated Lugol solution was added for thyroid storm empirically. Cordarone infusion was stopped. Digoxin level was 0.87 ng/mL, and was titrated to 0.125mg QD PO. Yeast colonization was found in sputum culture and urine culture, and cash Anidulafungin was started. Rheumatologist was consulted, and secondary hemophagocytosis was diagnosed. Solu-cortef 50mg Q8H was changed to solu-medrol 10mg Q8H for immunomodulation. Plaquenil was also added. Cash IVIg 0.5 g/kg daily was started for critical condition on 2016/5/13. Partial improvement of tachycardia was found on 2016/5/14.

   Stop Flagyl after 10-day course for CDI.
   Recheck CD toxin test.
2. BiPAP support for desaturation and aggravated lung edema
3. Inotropic agents use if needed
4. DC coumadin due to prolong INR (5/8: 4.13)
-> 5/9 INR 6.6, stat VitK 5mg 
   Monitor INR QD
   Component therapy for prevention of internal bleeding after liver biopsy

   Follow-up serum digoxin level on 5/16.
6. beware of thyrotoxicosis, follow up thyroid function on 5/16, pursue TBII results
-> Keep PTU 100mg TID as anti-thyroid drug
-> close monitor liver function and white cell count
-> Taper diluted Lugol solution if tachycardia improved.
9. Arrange gallium scan for infection focus survey. (5/14打藥, 5/16照相)
10.Pursue Igra
11.Pursue pathology report on 5/16 (P張逸良)
12.Consider Swan-Ganz catheter if unstable hemodynamic status, however, bleeding diasthesis, suspect IE and active infection should be carefully considered.

5/10 CV林: keep abx
     CV張: keep abx. Arrange Gallium scan
     ID盛: surgical management may be taken into consideration due to recurrent fever. TB granulomatous hepatitis should be ruled out. But liver biopsy was not feasible due to coagulopathy. Liver microabscess should be ruled out, but contrast CT was not feasible due to recent AKI and thyroitoxicossis. May arrange Gallium scan.
     CVS陳: surgical management may be done for infection control. (W5) 
     => suggest TEE by CV VS Lin at 5/11 PM
     Radiologist李: bilateral lower lobe lung lesion, favor partial atelectasis. Multiple tiny lung nodules, r/o atypical pathogens, r/o old TB.
5/11 ID:
1. Keep iv teicoplanin with 12 mg/Kg/day, change meropenem to iv levofloxacin 750 mg QD iv. Adjusted by renal function.
2. Cardiac echo follow up, consider liver biopsy, sent to pathology, cultures for TB, bacteria and fungus if biopsy available. Granulomatous hepatitis or lymphoma liver infiltrates should be rule out (increase ALP, LDH).
Endocrine CR王: cannot differentiate thyrotoxicosis and euthyroid syndrome now. Follow-up thyroid function on 5/13.
No goiter when bed-side visit.
5/12 Endocrinologist(邱): thyroid storm was not likely.
     Endocrinolgoist(曾): 
       - thyroid storm was not likely.
       - may add low dose PTU 100mg TID for highly suspected thyrotoxicosis (Afib, unexplained jaundice, fever, CHF, tremor, WHO grade 1 goiter, relative hypoechogenicity of thyroid gland)
       - anti-thyroid drugs may be complicated with neutropenia or abnormal liver function. Close monitoring.
     Hematologist(CR姚): PB smear revealed very small amount of fragmented RBCs. DIC was favored.
     GI(CR林): consider echo-guided liver biopsy after stable condition

     ID: 
       - Granulomatous hepatitis or lymphoma liver infiltrates should be rule out (increase ALP, LDH).
       - Check Igra
       - Bilaterally pulmonary infiltrates developed in recent 1 week. Heart failure may be considered.

     Rheumatology(謝): 
       - add plaquenil for immunomodulation.
       - suggest casg IVIg infusion 2g/kg in 4 days due to critical condition and possible underlying hematology/rheumatology disease

     ID: add cash anidulafungin for yeast colonization empirically.
     Radiologist(劉): feasible for plugged liver biopsy  
5/14 Rheumatology(謝): Keep IVIg.
     CV(張): 
       - If VT, DC shock and ECMO support.
