Brief Summary of this week    
After transferred to 4B1, air-borne isolation was done. Anti-TB drug with Cravit + Amikacin + Rifabutin + Ethambutol were kept after transfer. Hydration, calcitonin and biphosphonate were given for hypercalcemia. Progressive hyperbilirubinemia was still noticed. Therefore, plaquenil, ethambutol were discontinued on 2016/05/18. AFRVR still noticed, therefore, concor and herbesser were added for rate control. Sputum PJP PCR showed positive, due to Sevatrim not suitable (due to abnormal liver function) to the patient, anidulafungin was given. Progres elevate free T4 were still noticed even under Lugol's solution use. Cash plasma exchange started on 2016/5/19 after endocrine conference disucssion. Carbimazole 1# TID was also added. Imipenem was also added since 2016/05/20 for synergistic effect for Mycobacterial infection and cover resistant Enterobacterial infection according to ID doctor's suggestion. His hyperbilirubinemia, thyroid function, ferritin level and his heart rate all decreased after plasma exchange. Refractory hypernatremia and progress hypercalcemia were still noticed even under hydration and drugs treatment Hemodialysis was applied on 2016/05/21 for correct the electrolyte problem. Thyrogen was given once daily for two days during 2016/05/22-23. Then I-131 7mCi was given on 2016/05/24 according endocrine doctor suggestion. 1st round PE was completed on 2016/05/25. Targocid was added since 2016/05/26 due to sputum culture showed MRSA according ID doctor suggestion. Newmazole was added back since 2016/5/26 due to elevated fre T4 again. Plaquenil was added back and solumedrol decreased to 10mg Q12H since 2016/05/26 according rheumatologist suggestion.

Assessment 
[Important consultation]
5/8 ID: shift ceftazidime to meropenem, keep teicoplanin
        suggest surgical intervention
5/9 Endocrine³¯: 
    - Stop cordarone due to high FT4 and low TSH.
    - May add PTU if symptomatic thyrotoxicosis.
    - Suggest to repeat thyroid function after 1 week
    CVS³\: 
    - pursue further infection focus survey
    - may arrange CAG for susp. CAD
    CV±i: 
    - Resume digoxin 0.125mg QOD for Afib after stopping cordarone.
5/10 CVªL: keep abx
     CV±i: keep abx. Arrange Gallium scan
     ID²±: surgical management may be taken into consideration due to recurrent fever. TB granulomatous hepatitis should be ruled out. But liver biopsy was not feasible due to coagulopathy. Liver microabscess should be ruled out, but contrast CT was not feasible due to recent AKI and thyroitoxicossis. May arrange Gallium scan.
     CVS³¯: surgical management may be done for infection control. (W5) 
     => suggest TEE by CV VS Lin at 5/11 PM
     Radiologist§õ: bilateral lower lobe lung lesion, favor partial atelectasis. Multiple tiny lung nodules, r/o atypical pathogens, r/o old TB.
5/11 ID:
1. Keep iv teicoplanin with 12 mg/Kg/day, change meropenem to iv levofloxacin 750 mg QD iv. Adjusted by renal function.
2. Cardiac echo follow up, consider liver biopsy, sent to pathology, cultures for TB, bacteria and fungus if biopsy available. Granulomatous hepatitis or lymphoma liver infiltrates should be rule out (increase ALP, LDH).
Endocrine CR¤ý: cannot differentiate thyrotoxicosis and euthyroid syndrome now. Follow-up thyroid function on 5/13.
No goiter when bed-side visit.
5/12 Endocrinologist(ªô): thyroid storm was not likely.
     Endocrinolgoist(´¿): 
       - thyroid storm was not likely.
       - may add low dose PTU 100mg TID for highly suspected thyrotoxicosis (Afib, unexplained jaundice, fever, CHF, tremor, WHO grade 1 goiter, relative hypoechogenicity of thyroid gland)
       - anti-thyroid drugs may be complicated with neutropenia or abnormal liver function. Close monitoring.
     Hematologist(CR«À): PB smear revealed very small amount of fragmented RBCs. DIC was favored.
     GI(CRªL): consider echo-guided liver biopsy after stable condition
     Radiologist(R): consider CT-guided liver biopsy after stable condition. Discuss about transjugular liver biopsy
     ID: 
       - Granulomatous hepatitis or lymphoma liver infiltrates should be rule out (increase ALP, LDH).
       - Check Igra
       - Bilaterally pulmonary infiltrates developed in recent 1 week. Heart failure may be considered.
5/13 Endocrine(P´¿): add diluted Lugol solution for susp. thyroid storm due to persisted hyperbilirubinemia and tachycardia.
     Rheumatology(ÁÂ): 
       - add plaquenil for immunomodulation.
       - suggest casg IVIg infusion 2g/kg in 4 days due to critical condition and possible underlying hematology/rheumatology disease
       - consider clexane use
     ID: add cash anidulafungin for yeast colonization empirically.
     Radiologist(¼B): feasible for plugged liver biopsy  
5/14 Rheumatology(ÁÂ): Keep IVIg. Consider Clexane. 
     CV(±i): 
       - If VT, DC shock and ECMO support.
       - Taper Lugol solution if tachycardia improved.
       - Hold Clexane due to bleeding tendency and partial improvement of tachycardia after Lugol solution.
5/23 Dr.§d°ûºÕ: no need to add thyroxin after I-131 use, add newmazole 1# QD 3 days later 
VS.§E: discontinue BiPAP

PAP5

Assessment 
5/15 Rheumatology(ÁÂ): Keep IVIg. use Clexane once. r/o 2nd APS
5/17 Rheumatology(ÁÂ): keep solumedrol 
5/18 ID VS²± cash anidulafungin for PJP
     DC plaquenil and ethambutol
-> VS.ÁÂªQ¬w: suggested so rapid passed IVIG effect may indicate hematology problem, suggested no tapper steroid, even consider emperical chemotherapy (may use etoposide) but high risk must inform the patient and his family 
Endocrinologist(ªô): suggested it sencondary problem due to poor underlying disease poor control
Endocrinolgoist(´¿): will discuss on endocrine conference tomorrow, suggested tapper lugol solution
5/20 Hema «À©ú: Suggest whole body with/without contrast CT to evaluate if lymphadenopathy existed.
ID ²±: add Imipenam for enhance anti-TB treatment and anti-GNB effect
Rheuma VS.ÁÂªQ¬w: suggested f/u ferritin and T-bil next W1, if keep decline, could consider tapper steroid and add back plaquenil

5/21 
Dr.§d°ûºÕ: DC newmazole today. Start thyrogen for consecutive two days. MUST make sure that he takes I131 within 24hrs after the last dose of thyrogen.
