Brief Summary of this week    
This 38-year-old man was admitted because of SjS related ILD and ARDS, and ICH developed during ECMO support.
     We explained that there was no brainstem reflex noted to his family, and suggested hospice care. His family asked for alternative therapy performed by themselves, and still wanted to keep current treatment. Intermittent polyuria and hyperglycemia were noted, and we suspected them as SIADH related complication.
