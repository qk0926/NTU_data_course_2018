After admission, the patient recieved CVVH on 8/3. CVVH machine showed "access to negative" very frequently and the dialysis was discontinued prematurely. Acidosis improved on ABG follow-up on 8/4 despite CVVH was not completed.

The patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain at the ICU. Diagnostic paracentesis at the ER confirmed SBP. Tazocin and ciprofloxain were administered after being admitted to the ICU. Blood pressure had been relative stable under Levophed (16mcg/250cc) 5cc/hr support. CVVH was changed to SLEDD on 8/4. SLEDD was performed smoothly on 8/4 and 8/5. Blood culture and right PCN urine culture both reported Serratia marcescens which is sensitve to Tazocin and quinolones. The ascites culture obtained at the ER revealed no aerobic pathogens.

Muscle guarding and increased abdominal pain developed on 8/4. Abdominal CT was arranged and showed no evidence of bowel perforation. Mild gallbladder wall thickening and severe left hydronephrosis with atrophic renal cortex were also identified on the CT. After consulting a radiologist, acute cholescystis and left renal abscess formation were not favored. Due to massive ascites, paracentesis was repeated on 8/5 night. 2500cc turbid yellowish ascites were drained and sent for study. Ascites amylase and creatinine level were not elevated.

Progressively profound shock and increased O2 demand (on mask 60%, 10L) developed on 8/5 night after SLEDD. Levophed dosage was escalated and Pitrissin was added for blood pressure support. Tazocin was changed to Doripenem empirically. CXR follow up showed bilateral pleural effusion and RUL atelactasis. Left side thoracocentesis was attempted but only about 180cc orange pleural effusion could be drained.
