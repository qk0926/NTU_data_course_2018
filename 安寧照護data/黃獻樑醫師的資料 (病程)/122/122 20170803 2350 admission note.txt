Informant: patient herself and her daughter
Epigastric pain, decreased urine output for days 
病史(Brief History) 
This 62-year-old female has been diagnosed with 
 (1) Gastric outlet obstruction, favor duodenal stenosis, status post gastrojejunostomy on 2017/03/22
 (2) Cervical cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, status post loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) on 2016/11/30, pT1bNxMX, at least stage IIB, margin/lymphovascular invasion(+), status post radiation therapy radiation therapy and intracavitary brachytherapy, total 54Gy/30fractions(2017/01/05-2017/03/03), incomplete due to renal insufficiency
 (3) Right hydronephrosis, chronic polypoid ureteritis related, status post double-J insertion(2016/09/01-2016/10/17), status post percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) insertion (2016/12), status post revision (2017/1 and 2017/5/16)
 (4) Chronic kindey disease, stage 5
 (5) History of recurrent urinary tract infection 

The patient presented with nausea and vomiting in 2016/07. On examination, azotemia and hydronephrosis were noted. Thus, she was referred to the Urology department in 2016/08. Ureterscope on 2016/08/30 showed severe stricture at right middle and upper ureter. Antegrade double J insertion was performed on 2016/09/01. Ureterorenoscopic biopsy of the ureter revealed polypoid ureteritis. 

Acute kidney injury and severe right hydronephrosis was noted in 2016/10. A right PCN was inserted and the right double J tube was removed. During survey for hydronephrosis, elevated CA125 level had been noted. The patient was referred to a gynechologist. Pap smear on 2016/10/18 revealed CIN3. She recevied LEEP conization on 2016/11/30 and pathology showed squamous cell carcinoma. Definite EBRT 54Gy and intracavitary brachytherapy for 3 times were carried out from 2017/1/5-2017/03/03). Palliative RT to the abdominal lymphnodes is scheduled in 2017/08.

Nausea and vomiting developed again in 2017/03. EGD was arranged and showed duodenal stenosis. She then recevied gastrojejunostomy on 2017/03/22. After operation, vomiting improved. The patient discharged against advise in 2017/04 after symptoms improved.

Bile vomitus was noted in 2017/05. Vertigo was also reported. Thus, she came to ER of this hospital for help. Lab exams revealed progressively deteriorating renal functions (BUN/Cr:42.5/3.9 on 2017/04/02 to 78.4/6.1 on 2017/05/15). PCN revision was performed on 2017/05/16. Severe vomiting occured on 05/21. A NG tube was inserted and 3000 mL bile-like fluid was drained. Due to suspected obstruction, EGD was arranged on 2017/05/24 but revealed patent bowel loops. Progressively deteroirating renal function with mild acidosis were noted on serial lab exams. Left lower leg edema was also noticed. Vascular duplex showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. Burinex was added for the left leg edema. Urine output was adequate after burinex use (daily urine output: 1200-1600ml per day). There were no indication of emergent hemodialysis. The patient took a taxi went home instead on 2017/06/09. She was discharged against medical advice.

This time, she visited the ER due to epigastric pain, decreased urine output (1200cc/day to 100cc/day) and turbid urine for days. Associated symptoms include greenish stool passage, mild shortness of breath, lower extremities edema and mild confusion (according to the patient's daughter). There was no fever. Initial vital signs on ER arrival were as follow: Blood Pressure: 72/46mmHg, Pulse Rate: 86/min, Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 35.3℃, SPO2: 100%. Labratory examination revealed anemia (Hb:4.6), leukocytosis with left shift (WBC:21350), progressively deteriorating renal functions (BUN/Cr: 207/9.2), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.283, pCO2 14.5, HCO3- 6.9) and normal lactate level (0.93). The potassium level was within normal range. CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary edema. Empirical cefepime and levophed were given after septic workup. U/A showed pyuria. Abdominal sonography revealed some ascites. Paracentesis was performed and showed suspected spontanous peritonitis [Total nuclear cell count(TNC):7587, neutrophil predominance]. The cytology report is pending. Due to low blood pressure and severe metabolic acidosis, the patient is admitted to the ICU for CVVH treatment. On ICU admission, coffee-grounded materials were drained after NG insertion. Component therapy was provided and PPIs were administered.

醫療需求與治療計畫(Medical Needs and Care Plan) 
1. ACKD with metabolic acidosis
   - start CVVH on 8/3, shift to HD if BP stablizied
   - follow up ABG, electrolytes Q6H

2. Occult infection, suspect UTI and/or IAI
   - change antibiotics to Tazocin and ciproxin
   - pursue culture results

3. GI bleeding and anemia
   - give Nexium 40mg BID
   - component therapy as needed
     consider cryo for uremic bleeding
   - consider PES evaluation
   - NPO with IVF support

4. Ascites, cause to be determined
   - pending cytology results

Treatment Goal:
. Acidosis improved
. Longterm hemodialysis if indicated
