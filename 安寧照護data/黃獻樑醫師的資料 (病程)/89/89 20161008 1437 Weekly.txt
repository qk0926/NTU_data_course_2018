Brief Summary of this week 
After admission, mechanical ventilation was kept with dopamine use. Hypothermia was started at 8AM 10/5, but due to increased stress to the patient, temperature was kept around 34-35'C. CVVH was started on 10/5 for progressive acidosis. Due to shock in progression, Levophed was also added. Cordarone and lidocain was also added for frequent VPC requiring multiple electric shock. Hypothermia was also discontinued earlier at 7AM.  Due to STEMI, DAPT and heparinization was administered. Critical condition and poor neurological and CV outcome was informed to the family. Empirical antibiotic as cefuroxime followed by ceftriaxone was given. Due to intermittent hypotension suspect shock or autonomic dysfunction, a short course of Bosmin was given and Midodrine was administered. Antibiotic was upgrade to Mepem due to persistent fever with chills. His lactic acid gradually improved and started to have urine output but still high cardiac enzyme.

<Family decision>
10/5 Proceed with H/D
10/6 Fatal arrhythmia requiring frequent electric shock=> decided not to shock and CPR (°|«Å)
10/8 Still have hope due to eye rolling

Plan 
1.Keep DAPT, DC heparinization(10/5 03:00-10/7:03:23), other drugs for STEMI if consciousness improved
  Theraputic hypothermia (since 10/5 6:40AM-10/6 7:20) for 1 day due to deep coma after resuscitation
  EEG/brain perfusion next week?
  DNR except medication/MV/RRT now
   Discuss of withdraw
  CVVH [10/5 (12AM-)] for lactic acidosis, Rocephin prophylactic use
  Inform critical condition and poor neurological outcome due to prolonged resuscitation; also inform risk of AMI, including cardiac rupture, fatal arrhythmia, refractory cardiogenic shock
  DC Depakine due to elevated liver function, Add Keppra if needed
2.Amiodarone use, DC Xylocaine
3.D50W infusion with RI
