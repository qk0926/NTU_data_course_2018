Brief Summary of this week    
Due to improving blood pressure, dopamine and Levophed was discontinued. Cordarone was change to oral form but back to IV due to intermittent Afib RVR. Mepem was empirically used since 10/8 and intermittent fever was still noted and central fever was suspected. Brain EEG on 10/11 showed no discernible cortical activities. These findings are compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy. Brain perfusion scan on 10/12 also showed  upper brainstem and thalami showed severe hypoperfusion. Poor neurological outcome was informed to the family and they were still decided withdraw or tracheostomy. SIMV mode was tried and stress to his heart with Afib RVR and poor cooperation was found and was changed back to PC/AC mode. 

Problem Assessment Plan

Plan 
1.Keep DAPT, DC heparinization (10/5 03:00-10/7:03:23), other drugs for STEMI if consciousness improved
  Add Concor since 10/15
  EEG(2016/10/11)/brain perfusion(2016/10/12) 
  DNR except medication/MV/RRT now
  Discuss of withdraw/tracheostomy due to poor neurological outcome
  Inform critical condition and poor neurological outcome due to prolonged resuscitation; also inform risk of AMI, including cardiac rupture, fatal arrhythmia, refractory cardiogenic shock
  DC Depakine due to elevated liver function, Add Keppra if needed
2.Amiodarone use, change to oral Cordarone due to still intermittent Afib RVR
3.Keep Mepem, pursue cultures
4.Try oral intake (low protein diet, 1500kcal, 1.5kcal/mL)
5.Family will discuss about tracheostomy, they may make the descision in 2 days
