Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, we kept Brosym for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Rasitol was prescribed for urine output decrease and fair response. Prokients was prescribed for poor digestion and suspect ileus. NG feeding via NG tube with semi-milk was tried and shifted to milk gradually. Previous followed blood culture yielded Streptococcus bovis I (II/II) and we shifted antibiotic to Maxipime for better coverage. Repeated blood culture on 8/29 and data were negative and we shifted antibiotic to Ampolin since 9/06 for suspect infective endocarditis treatment. We held family meeting on 9/07 for poor prognosis and hospice was consulted on 9/08 for combine care. We will closely monitor her clinical condition. There was no obvious adverse drug reaction throughout the hospitalization course.
