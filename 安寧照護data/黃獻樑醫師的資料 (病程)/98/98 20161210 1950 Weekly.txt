[Studies]
12/08 和平醫院 CT and MRI: 
      Radiologist common: suspect HIV encephalitis, CJD not 
      likely
12/09 EEG: still epileptic forms
12/09 status elilepticus survey:
      DIC profile
      tumor markers
      autoimmune panels
      HIV infection
12/12 Anti-NMDA ab profiles:
      Repeat EEG

[Consultation]
2016/12/09 
NEU Common:
Rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
Encephalopathy, cause to be determined
1. Please arrange EEG as soon as possible. 
2. Consult neuroradiologist for the MRI in 和平 Hospital. 
3. Check DIC profile, tumor markers, autoimmune panels and HIV infection. 
4. Arrange cardiac echo. 
5. Check liver function, renal function and electrolyte. 
6. May consider to send CSF for autoimmune encephalitis. 

[Family decision]
[Intervention]

Plan 
1. For suspected encephalitis with NCSE
-> continue Anxicam infusion
-> continue Levetiracetam
-> Pursue CSF TB, HSV, EBV, VZV 
-> Check HIV and anti-NMDA ab, repeat EEG

2. For Rhabdomyolysis with ARF(2016/12/08)
-> Give regular loops diuretics to optimize UOP for globulin 
   clearance and relief fluid overloading
-> continued lactate ringer and hydration to maintain 
   adequate UOP(First priority!!)
-> Check ABG, DC Rokikan if no systemic acidosis
   (Sodium bicarbonate had no benefit if no acidosis, however 
    hypocalcemia would followed)
-> Be aware of electrolytes imbalance(K,Ca,P,Mg..etc)
-> RRT as indicated

3. Monitor the heart condition (CAD with previous MI likely)
-> f/u cardiac echo
