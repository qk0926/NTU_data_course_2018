Brief Summary of this week    
After admitted, aggressive hydration with dyuratic was used for treat of rhabdomyolysis (seizure related). The EEG was arranged for evaluation of seizure on 12/09, the NEU was consulted, and non-convulsive status epilepticus was impressed. The Anxicam & Levetiracetam were prescribed. The etiology was surveyed, and anti-NMDA ab would be followed up. 

However, the unstablized blood pressure noted, and levophed pump was prescribed in 12/09 morning. The levophed tapped gradually, and DC on 12/10. The followed up EEG on 12/13 showed no more epileptic form, then the BZD discontinued. Current no recurrd seizure, the EEG was arranged on 12/16, would f/u the result, and keep touched with NEU.

[Consultation]
2016/12/09 
NEU Common:
Rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
Encephalopathy, cause to be determined
1. Please arrange EEG as soon as possible. 
2. Consult neuroradiologist for the MRI in 和平 Hospital. 
3. Check DIC profile, tumor markers, autoimmune panels and HIV infection. 
4. Arrange cardiac echo. 
5. Check liver function, renal function and electrolyte. 
6. May consider to send CSF for autoimmune encephalitis. 

[Family decision]
[Intervention]

Plan 
1. For suspected encephalitis with NCSE
-> continue Levetiracetam
-> repeat EEG next week
-> Pursue anti-NMDA ab (自費)

2. Rhabdomyolysis with ARF, resolved
-> monitor RFT
