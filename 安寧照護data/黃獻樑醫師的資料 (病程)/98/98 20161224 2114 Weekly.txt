Brief Summary of this week    
After admitted, aggressive hydration with dyuratic was used for treat of rhabdomyolysis (seizure related). The EEG was arranged for evaluation of seizure on 12/09, the NEU was consulted, and non-convulsive status epilepticus was impressed. The Anxicam & Levetiracetam were prescribed. The etiology was surveyed, and anti-NMDA ab would be followed up.
Current the followed up NMDA ab showed -, and the followed up EEG reported moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphesis on the right side. We had informed the families the poor prognosised. The family meeting was arranged on 12/23, and families asked withdrawing Life-Sustaining treatment on 12/27.

[Consultation]
2016/12/09 
NEU Common:
Rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
Encephalopathy, cause to be determined
1. Please arrange EEG as soon as possible. 
2. Consult neuroradiologist for the MRI in 和平 Hospital. 
3. Check DIC profile, tumor markers, autoimmune panels and HIV infection. 
4. Arrange cardiac echo. 
5. Check liver function, renal function and electrolyte. 
6. May consider to send CSF for autoimmune encephalitis. 

[Family decision]
[Intervention]

Plan 
1. For suspected encephalitis with NCSE
-> continued oral form Keppra
-> anti-NMDA Ab (-)
-> may withdrawing Life-Sustaining treatment on 12/27

2. Rhabdomyolysis with ARF, resolved
