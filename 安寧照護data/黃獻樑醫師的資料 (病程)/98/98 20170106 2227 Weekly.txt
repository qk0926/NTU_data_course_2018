Brief Summary of this week    
The patient remained unclear conscious during this week. Dyspnea with desactuation was noted on 1/4 afternoon. We completed septic work. Lab data showed remarkable leukocytosis, and chest X ray showed infiltration over right lower lung. We informed the possibility and risk of hospital acquired pneumonia or progression of meningoencephalitis to his family. Family meeting was conducted on 1/5, and his family decided to remove oxygen supply on 1/7 morning, and they had signed permit. We also contacted with hospice team for terminal care. Therefore, we will remove oxygen supply tomorrow morning and give adequate pain control.
