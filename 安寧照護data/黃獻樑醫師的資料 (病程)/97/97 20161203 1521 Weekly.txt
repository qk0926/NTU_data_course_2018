Brief Summary of this week    
His blood pressure was too low in which Levophed, Dopamine, Bosmin and Vasopressin were needed. TTM 33C was not done. He had hypothermia (32-35C) by himself. Poor prognosis was told to family and they signed DNR, refusing defibirillation and chest compression but agreeing with cardioversion. Vasopression was tapered off first on 2016/11/27. His lactic acidosis improved after tapering Bosmin on 2016/11/28. Right pneumothorax improved after chest tube insertion. Day-3 EEG was done on 2016/11/30. PiCCO was removed on 2016/11/30, tip culture sent.
   
12/01-12/03
     During this week, he is under deep comatose status (E1VTM1) with sluggish light reflex. EEG on 11/30 revealed severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. EEG and perfusion CT scan was shceduled on 12/05.
     Pneumonia and septic shock status improved slowly. Antibiotics was upgraded to meropenam. Under antibiotics treatment, pneumonia improved gradually. 
     Further long term care plan will discussed after brain perfusion and EEG study.

[Antibiotics]
meropenam 12/02-

-------------------
Cefepime 11/27~12/1 
    
[Consultation]
nil

Plan 
1. keep meropenam and intensive chest care
   check culture of pleural effusion 
2. CT perfusion and EEG on D7 (next monday)
3. Informed family about garve prognosis 
   Refuse defibirillation and chest compression but agree 
   cardioversion
   Family prefered active withdrawal but not confirmed
