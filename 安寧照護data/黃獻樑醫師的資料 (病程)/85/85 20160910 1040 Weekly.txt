Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, mepem and targocid was given for wound infection and pneumonia. Wound culutre showed wild type KP and MSSA. Targocid was DC due to no evidence. Right thoracentesis was performed and analysis showed exudate, no bacteria visible and negative for malignant cells. Lab showed lower albumin. Cash albumin was given. Severe hypoglycemia (glucose <10 mg/dL) was noted. D50W infusion was given. Lab showed ACTH 15.6, cortisol 5.13. TSH 0.156, and free T4 0.416. Endocrine department was consulted. Relative adrenal insufficiency, suspect iatrogenic related or central type and low T4 and TSH, suspect steroid related, sick euthyroid syndrome or central type was impressed. Eltroxin and steroid was given. Lab showed insulin <2.00, and C-peptide 3.89 under one touch <60 and ATA 3.32, anti-TPO <3.0, T3<40. Hypoglycemia, suspect poor appetite, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and tumor related was suspected. He was in coma status, and we contacted with oncologist (Dr陳國興) for buccal cancer. He suggested 1) suggested DNR; 2) may consider radiotherapy but patient was unstable condition and no further chemotherapy. After discussed with his family, they decided to DNR 不電不壓. Hospice was consulted. Coffee ground was noted since 9/9. Nexium was kept. Lab showed increased Crea. Oligouria was noted. We discussed with his family about hemodialysis and they received DNR 不電不壓不洗腎. Under relative stable codition, mepem was downgrade to tazocin. Ventilator was weaning. But under PS PS6, PEEP 5 for 1 hour, dyspnea and high blood pressure was noted.
