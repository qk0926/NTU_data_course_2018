Brief Summary of this week 
She was transferred to MICU on 11/16 for large amount pericardial effusion, and CV was consulted for pericardiocentesis. UCG showed no RV collapse sign, so emergent pericardiocentesis was not indicated. However, dyspnea and cold sweating developed at 11/16 night, as well as hypotension. Respiratory distress was observed on 11/17 morning, so after explaination to her family and obtaining inform consent, intubation was done. Profound shock developed after intubation, and fluid resuscitation + Levophed were given. Fever was also observed, so antibiotic was upgraded to Tazocin. Pericardiocentesis was then performed with pigtail insertion on 11/17 smoothly. Much bloody pericardial effusion was drained, and her blood pressure became more stable. Septic shock or cardiogenic shock was favored, and PiCCO was used from 11/17 to 11/21 to monitor her hemodynamic parameters. Inotropics were adjusted according to SVRI and cardiac index. We also contacted P. 余忠仁 for her lung cancer-related treatment, and he suggested to send pericardial effusion for EGFR mutation and cell block. He also explained to her family that her disease status was terminal. Her family preferred DNR if her condition worsened, but the permit was not signed yet. Dobutamine and Levophed were tapered off, and Dopamine was kept to maintain adequate cardiac output. We'll follow-up UCG to evaluate her LV function, and P-P window creation will be done next week.

[Important Interventions and Newly Added Medications]
11/16 ICU admission: close monitor/prepare for pericardiocentesis
11/17 ETT+MV, NS 1000ml+levophed for hypotension
      pericardiocentesis: 720ml bloody pericardial effusion
      Shift antibx to Tazocin, RIJV CVC+PiCCO for shock
11/18 add Dobutamine
11/20 off Dobutamine, taper Levophed, add Dopamine
11/21 remove PiCCO, off Levophed

[Important Consultation and Meeting Suggestions]
11/16 CV: No RV Collapse sign, emergent pericardiocentesis not indicated
11/17 余P: cancer-related treatment is not suitable now; already informed poor prognosis to her family; check pericardial effusion EGFR mutation and cell block if enough sample

[Important Family Decisions]
11/17 agreed intubation, pericardiocentesis and CVC insertion
11/18 agreed cash-PPI use
11/18 家屬已有DNR共識但最終決定權在父親

Plan 
1. keep Tazocin use for HAP, 10-14 days
   inform family difficult weaning possibility and they 
   will consider tracheostomy issue
2. Keep dopamine for hemodynamic support
   monitor BP and U/O as clinical markers
   repeat UCG(after pericardiocentesis) to r/o 
   contrictive pericarditis
3. Inform family critical condition and management plan, 
   pending family's decision about DNR
4. Family agreed with PP window creation. Scheduled next 
   week
