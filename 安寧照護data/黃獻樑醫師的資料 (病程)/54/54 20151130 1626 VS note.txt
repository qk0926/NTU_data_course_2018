Suggest:

-> tapering off vasopressors as the agreement with family
-> SBP around 85, urine output decreased
-> adequate pain and sedative for comfort care
-> keep on present comfort care
-> inform family grave prognosis 
-> already palliative care team
-> pain control and mild sedative for comfort care
