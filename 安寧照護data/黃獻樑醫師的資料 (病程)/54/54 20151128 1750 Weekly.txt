Brief Summary of this week
P-P window creation was done smoothly on 11/23. Pigtail drainage amount < 50ml/day for three days, so it was removed on 11/26. Fever developed on 11/24, so antibiotic was shifted to Meropenem. Vomiting developed and NG decompression drained much content since 11/24, and poor bowel movement was found. Abdominal CT done on 11/13 revealed cancerous peritonitis, so cancer-related ileus was favored. She was then kept NPO with PPN support. Dopamine could not be tapered despite P-P window creation. We had inquired Dr.余忠仁 about her treatment plan, and he suggested palliative care. Expected life span was less then one month, so we informed her family about her poor prognosis. They agreed with palliative care, so hospice was consulted on 11/27. Dopamine was then gradually tapered, and no more increase will be made.

[Important Interventions and Newly Added Medications]
11/16 ICU admission: close monitor/prepare for pericardiocentesis
11/17 ETT+MV, NS 1000ml+levophed for hypotension
      pericardiocentesis: 720ml bloody pericardial effusion
      Shift antibx to Tazocin, RIJV CVC+PiCCO for shock
11/18 add Dobutamine
11/20 off Dobutamine, taper Levophed, add Dopamine
11/21 remove PiCCO, off Levophed
11/23 P-P window creation
11/24 hold feeding and add Primperan
11/25 Fever, septic work up, shift abx to Mepem
11/26 pigtail removed

[Important Consultation and Meeting Suggestions]
11/16 CV: No RV Collapse sign, emergent pericardiocentesis not indicated
11/17 余P: cancer-related treatment is not suitable now; already informed poor prognosis to her family; check pericardial effusion EGFR mutation and cell block if enough sample
11/24 余P: poor prognosis, estimated 2-4 weeks survival, suggest palliative care
11/27 Hospice combined care

[Important Family Decisions]
11/17 agreed intubation, pericardiocentesis and CVC insertion
11/18 agreed cash-PPI use
11/18 家屬已有DNR共識但最終決定權在父親
11/23 Family agreed with tracheostomy creation
11/24 inform poor prognosis, will discuss about withdrawal
11/26 signed DNR, prefer withdrawal
11/27 diverse opinions of withdrawal; agreed with palliative care
11/28 家屬同意不再往上調整 Dopamine

Plan 
1. Keep Mepem. Complete abx 14 day totally
   no more cutlure work-up
2. Taper Dopamine, 家屬同意不再往上調整
3. PPN for cancerous peritonitis, try D5W feeding 50ml Q8H
4. Hospice combined care
5. DNR 全拒院宣
