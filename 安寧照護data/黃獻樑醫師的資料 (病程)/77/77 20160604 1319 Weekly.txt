Brief Summary of this week    
[Treatment course 06/03-]
The patient was admitted to ICU for status epilepticus and desaturation with respiratory failure status post ETT+MV on 06/03 evening. Sustained seizure attack was noticed after admission and anxicam pump with phenytoin, depakine, and keppra were added for seizure control. CVC was inserted. Empirical antibiotic Maxipime was added for suspected CNS and pulmonary infection. Coffee ground substance was noticed and NPO with IVF and PPI was given. GCSF cash was given for neutropenia state noticed. Improved and decreased seizure attack was noticed since midnight.
Primary oncologist was consulted and suggested repeated CSF study for proving leptomeningeal seeding and Omaya insetion later. Lumbar puncture with CSF study was performed on 06/04 for suspected CNS infection and leptomeningeal seeding with open/close pressre 27/17 cmH2O. Antibitoic Metronidazole was added for suspected aspiration pneumonia. Desaturation was noticed in the afternoon and absence seizure with desaturation or ETT malposition was suspected. Adjustment of ETT position was done with improvement noticed. Neurologist was consulted for further seizure control. Vancomycin was added for full CNS infection coverage and anxicam pump was switched to dormicum pump. Improved WBC was noticed and GCSF was discontinued. Mild hypotension was noticed and levophed was added for inotropic support.

6/4 LP: CSF study, Anxicam pump change to Dormicum pump.

<Imporant consultation>
6/3 Onco: consider IT, give cash G-CSF, consult neuro
6/3 Neuro: did CSF study, empirical antibiotic,adjust AED, consider brain image
6/4 NeuroCR程: add Vancomycin, change anxicam to dormicum pump, add Topamax 1# QD if DC NPO, followup EEG

<Important patient's and family's decisions>
6/3 agree cash G-CSF and PPI
    agree CVC, CSF study, brain MRI, thoracocentasis, permit signed
    agree IT
    favor no defibrillation or cardiac massage if sudden cardiac arrest
6/4 family concerned about AEDs+BZD use.

Plan 
1. Keep strong AED and anxicam infusion for status epilepsy
=> change to Dormicum pump use as neurologist suggested

2. Ventilator support, monitor respiratory pattern
=> check chest echo, thoracocentasis if indicated
=> Right lower lung collpase or aspiration pneumonia favored.
=> keep antibiotic use and cautious with septic shock.

3. Complete septic work up and empirically Cefepime for febrile neutropenia and suspect CNS infection
=> add Metronidazole and Vancomycin use.

5. Contact oncologist for possbile IT and check CSF study at the same time
=> IT not suitable for acute infection condition now

6. Consider further brain image, pursue EEG formal reports. discuss with neurologist about AED adjustment if still poor controlled
