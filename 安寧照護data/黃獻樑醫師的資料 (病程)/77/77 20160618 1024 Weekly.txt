Brief Summary of this week    
6/12-6/18
Breakthrough fever in the morning and afternoon was noticed on 6/11. Repeated septic workup was done and Vancomycin was added. Dormicum pump for seizure control was given and uptitrated. Peristent fever was noticed on 6/12, and ice blanket use was given. Intermittent focal seizure was still noticed on 6/13, and Dormicum pump was kept. Neurologist suggested tapering Depakine, and titrating up Topamax and adding Rivotril. Oncologist explained to the family and suggested DNR and explained the limited effect of IT chemotherapy. Low procalcitonin level was found and improved RLL collapse was found on followup CXR. Family agreed with IT and oral chemotherapy on 6/14. Intra-thecal chemotherapy with MTX was given on 6/14 as C1D1. Cash albumin + diuretics were given. DNR除藥不電不壓不重插 was signed. Weaning process was kept. Depakine was discontinued and Rivotril was kept. Oral chemotherapy Xeloda started since 6/15. Intermittent seizure, non-sustained was still noticed. Fever without other vital sign change was still noticed and ice blanket was used. Hospice was consulted for combined care and for family's gradual acceptance. On 6/18, Dormicum pump was down titrated. Intermittent self limited seizure was noticed. Followup CXR showed no RLL collapse. Improved fever curve under ice blanket and regular paramol was noticed. Septic workup was repeated. Further weaning process and 2nd IT chemotherapy would be kept.

Plan 
1. Keep Cravit for 14days and DC Vancomycin 
-> Keep regularly paramol for suspect tumor fever
-> repeat septic work-up on 6/18

2. Keep strong AED and and Dormicum pump infusion with titration, monitor neurological sign and seizure
-> Titrate Rivotril, taper Midazolam if possible

3. Ventilator support, SIMV mode, weaning gradaully
-> be ware of lung collapse 
-> diuretic to dry lung, Rasitol 20mg Q8H with albumin(6/14-6/16)

5. Infromed poor neurological outcome
-> DNR was signed, agree no re-intubation
-> consult hospice for combined care 
-> Family consider 拔管不重插

6. For tumor treatment:  
=> IT chemotherapy on 6/14 then QW2
=> monitor if acute adverse effect
=> Oral chemotherapy Xeloda since 6/15
