Brief Summary of this week    
[Treatment course 6/5-6/11]
The patient was tapered off Dormicum pump on 6/5 for no seizure noted. Depakine, phenytoin and Keppra were kept for seizure control. NG feeding amount was uptitrated. On 6/6, the patient was kept on Alb supplement with diuretic for low alb and mild edema and increased body weight. Levophed was turned off. Ventilator setting was switched to SIMV mode. However, RLL collapse was noticed on 6/7 when the patient was shifted to PSV mode. Topamax 1# BID was added for further seizure control. Antibiotic was changed to Cravit for ESBL Ecoli in sputum culture. Brain MRI was done according to neurologist's suggested and showed progressive Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases. Oncologist suggested Omaya insertion with intrathecal chemotherapy. Family agree Omaya insertion then after explanation. On 6/8, persistent collapsed RLL/RML was noticed even under PCV mode. Bronchoscopy study was done and showed sputum impaction. Neurosurgeon was consulted for Omaya insertion. Intermittent PRN Dormicum given for intermittent focal seizure on 6/9. Scheduled operation for Omaya insertion was done on 6/10 and open pressure 10cmH2O was found. On 6/11, breakthrough fever was noticed in morning and afternoon. Septic workup was repeated and empirical antibiotic Vancomycin was added. Dormicum pump for seizure control was uptitrated for persistent seizure attacks.

<Important study findings>
6/4 CSF: WBC 54, L/N 32/22, Glu 42, TP 67.8
    Cytology: Postive, carcinoma
6/7 Brain MRI: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, in progression. Brain metastases.
6/8 Bronchoscopy
 1. Injected mucosa over L2C, favored suction trauma.
 2. Moderate amount of sticky sputum over left side bronchial trees.
 3. Moderate amount of purulent sputum over right side bronchial trees.
-> Bronchial washing to RML for cytology; bacterial, TB & fungal culture.
6/10 OP: Ommaya implantation
OP finding: Clear CSF was drained out after ventriculotomy and the ventricle was small. The open pressure was around 10 cmH2O. The catheter was 6.8 cm in length

<Imporant consultation>
6/3 Onco: consider IT, give cash G-CSF, consult neuro
6/3 Neuro: did CSF study, empirical antibiotic,adjust AED, consider brain image
6/4 NeuroCR程: add Vancomycin, change anxicam to dormicum pump, add Topamax 1# QD if DC NPO, followup EEG
6/5 Onco: IT not suitable for acute infection status
6/7 Onco張: suggested Omaya insertion with IT chemo
    Neuro鄭: suggested Brain MRI, add Topamax for still intermittent left facial focal seizure noticed, treat underlying problems, followup EEG if improved focal seizure noticed.
6/8 NS: for Omaya insertion, explain to family on 6/9 and surgery on 6/10 oncall
    Onco張: IT chemo after Omaya
6/10Onco張: suggest Omaya drainage CSF first and relieve pressure and do CSF, consider oral chemo
6/11Onoc張: suggested could start IT chemo on 6/12

<Important patient's and family's decisions>
6/3 agree cash G-CSF and PPI
    agree CVC, CSF study, brain MRI, thoracocentasis, permit signed
    agree IT
    favor no defibrillation or cardiac massage if sudden cardiac arrest
6/4 family concerned about AEDs+BZD use.
6/6 family want discuss with oncologist for further plan
    hesitate about tracheostomy and omaya implantation and further chemotherapy, afraid of long term care
6/7 Family agreed with Omaya insertion and IT chemotherapy
6/8 Family agreed wuth bronchoscope, and Omaya insertion
6/11Family wanna discuss with Oncologist about IT chemo effect and response

Plan 
1. Keep strong AED and PRN Dormicum use
-> monitor neurological sign and seizure, consider repeated EEG if no witnessed seizure again for 1 day
-> consider use Dormicum infusion if frequently seizure movement

2. Keep PCV support, higher IP and PEEP for RLL collpase

3. Keep Cravit for ESBL E.coli pneumonia
-> pursue bronchoscopy washing results

4. Infromed poor neurological outcome
-> suggest tracheosotmy due to poor consciousness

5. Post Ommaya reservoir implantation today, post-OP care
-> follow up pressure, confirmed with oncologist about the timing of chemotherapy 
-> family would like to discuss with Oncologist about IT treatment effect.

6. Diuretic to keep negative I/O, monitor fluid status and BW
