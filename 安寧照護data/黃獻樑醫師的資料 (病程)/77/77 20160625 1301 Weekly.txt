Brief Summary of this week    
Treatment course 6/19-6/25
Persistent fever without toxic sign was noticed. On 6/19, Naposin was given for suspected tumor fever. Increased seizure attack was noticed and Dormicum pump was titratedup. Improved fever was later found. Rivotril was uptitrated. Oral chemotherapy Xeloda and intra-thecal chemotherapy was discontinued due to family's request. Family favored withdrawal and extubation according to the patient's will. Family explained about weaning-extubation/withdrawal. Persistent apnea of the patient under PSV was found, and ventilator was shifted back to PC-SIMV. On 6/21, hospice was consulted about withdrawal for low potential of weaning/extubation. The patietn showed low weaning potential with markedly decreased Vt when down titrate setting. Hospice explained to the family about withdrawal process. On 6/23, the family signed withdrawal permit (sister and brother). Improved edema was noticed and the patient was prepared for withdrawal. Supportive and palliative care was kept. On 6/25, withdrawal with extubation was performed at 10:06AM. Dormicum + Morphine pump was used. Palliative care was kept with family accompany.
