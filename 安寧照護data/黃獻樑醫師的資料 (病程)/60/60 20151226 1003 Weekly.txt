Brief Summary of this week    
During this week, we noted she could open her eyes (sometimes response to voice and pain) but not actual eye contact. There was still intermittent fever spike under Maxipime, Ampicillin, Anegyn, and Vancomycin. The CSF culture showed wild type Klebsiella pneumoniae. The sputum culture on 12/18 was ESBL, so We upgraded antibiotic to Mepem. We arranged CT again on 12/24 (before the second times of lumbar puncture and ruled out brain abscess formation), which showed large territory infarcts in bilateral cerebral hemispheres (more on right side) with brain herniation and left infratemporoal fossa to middle cranial fossa tumor. Mannitol was prescribed for IICP. We informed her family about the poor prognosis and consulted neurologist, neurosurgeon, and hospice.
