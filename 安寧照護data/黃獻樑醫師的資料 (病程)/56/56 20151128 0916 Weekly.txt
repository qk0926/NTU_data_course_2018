Brief Summary of this week 
After admission, we added Cravit to cover atypical antigen. Then, we started prone position for poor P/F ratio but it was failure due to desaturation and low tidal volume. Therefore, we shifted to iNO therapy on 11/22 The auria and metabolic aciodsis was found, we started CVVH since 11/23. We contact Dr.謝松洲 and disccused with family, IVIG started form 11/22 to 11/25. The poor oxygenation persisted even under FiO2 100% support. After discussing with family, the VV ECMO was administrated since 11/23. The Endoxan pulse therapy was prescribed on 11/24 by Dr.謝's suggestion. We infromed family the grave condition and they signed DNR 不電不壓, 形式留一口氣回家. The Voriconazole was added due to suputum culture yield Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the oxygenation was still poor after aggrassive component therapy, hydration. Her family required withdrwal on 11/29. We consulted hospice for combine care.

[Important Interventions and Newly Added Medications]
11/21 Add Cravit to cover atypical pathogen
      Prone for poor P/F ratio 
      -> failed due to desaturation and low tidal volume
11/22 On iNO
11/23 CVVH
11/24 VV ECMO with CVVH, Endoxan 250mg pulse therapy
11/26 Add on Voriconazole for Aspergillus fumigatus in S/C

Plan
1. Keep Maxipime with Cravit for atypical PnA
   Keep Sevatrim for susp PJP infx, pursue culture data
   Keep Voriconazole for susp invasive aspergillosis
2. Vasopressors for hemodynamics, keep MAP>65
3. Keep MV and VV ECMO for lung full support 
4. Keep Solumedrol 16mg Q6H as rheumatologist suggested
   Complete IVIG (2g/kg, total 120g/4days) (11/22-11/25)
   and Endoxan pulse therapy (11/24)
5. Component therapy if indicated; keep ACT around 140s(lower limit due to severe oral bleeding); watch out progressed DIC.
6. Informed family about critical condition
   They signed DNR 不電不壓, 形式留一口氣回家
    They decided withdrwal on 11/29 15:00  if no response.
7. keep feeding to 安素 1250Kcal/1250cc/d; DC IVF.
8. Complete cash albumin course

Assessment
[Important Consultation and Meeting Suggestions]
11/21 Consult AIR 郭祐民: solumedrol 10mg q8h, PJP sputum PCR, add sevatrium empirically in addition to TAZOCIN
11/22 Rheuma Dr.謝: try IVIG.
      CVS: ECMO was indicated if needed.
11/24 Rheuma Dr.謝: try Endoxan pulse therapy, informed family about poor prognosis 
11/27 Hospice: 
  1. We had introduce hospice to families
  2. Treat current condition as your expertise
  3. Psychological support. 肯定疾病治療歷程，肯定家人陪伴，鼓勵四道人生。
  4. Hospice combined care is arranged. We will follow this patient.
  5. Thanks for consultation. Contact 東址共照辦公室(63274) for related questions.

[Important Family Decisions]
11/20 informed family about extubation recently, they would discuss about re-intubation if failure
11/22 Informed family of critical condition, they agreed H/D, CPCR or ECMO if indicated
11/24 signed DNR 不電不壓, 形式留一口氣回家
11/27 decide withdrwal on 11/29 if no improvement.
