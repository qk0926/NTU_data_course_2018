Brief Summary of this week    
On 2016/06/18, we changed Diflucan back to Anidulafungin for systemic fungemia and IE due to an ID doctor's advice. A follow-up brain CT was performed on the same day and showed stationary ICH with a little larger brain edema area and a small mass at right temporal lobe. Pancreatic carcinoma with metastasis of brain was suspected. The condition was well explained to her family and they decided the treatment goal would change to palliative care if condition is deteriorated.

    Since 2016/06/20, her GCS was E1M4Vt but few E1M1Vt was noted as well(no response to pain). Due to gradually worsening condition, palliative care was discussed with family and family meeting was held on 2016/06/22 14:00. Under signed DNR and two specialists confirming her a terminal patient, the terminal extubation was performed about 2016/06/22 13:10, and removed CVC and pigtail on 2016/06/23. We also hold unnecessary treatment and monitor, and remained morphine and some oral medication, e.g. diovan, betaloc, nexium, herbesser, and diflucan. Her condition was stable during these days, while decreased HR/RR/SpO2 was noted ( HR 90->70, RR 20->12 SpO2 99%->96% ).
