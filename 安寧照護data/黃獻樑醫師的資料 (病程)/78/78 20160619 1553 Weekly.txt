Brief Summary of this week    
After tranferral to 4C2, eraxis and meropenem were continously given.

On 6/11 rapid HR about 130 without BP drop at night. Under the impression of AfRVR, herbesser 1# bid was prescribed and concor was added later. On 6/13 we consulted ophthalmologist and ocular involvement was founded. Anidulafungin was changed to diflucan due to suggestion of pharmacist, while later on the infectionologist necessitate anidulafungin for candida IE. On 6/14 cardiac echo was performed and a 3.6*1.6 cm vegetation was noted. Cardiac surgery was indicated. On the same day right limb muscle weakness was noted. CT revealed ICH of 20ml. Therefore, her family decide not to undergo the surgery although it was indicated. under the impression of ICH, the hypertension was treated with Concor, and we added Diovan(ARB), and Perdipine(CCB) then. Mannitol was also given to treated her brain edema. Repeated CT on 6/18 showed stablized hematoma with increased edematous change. She should recieve further follow-up and management in ICU.

Non-VKA-oral anticoagulant would be considered
e.g. dabigatran, and xabans

-> herbesser and concor, add anticoagulant when ich stable
