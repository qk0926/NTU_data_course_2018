Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, Tazocin was given empirically. Hydration, Levophed and Pitressin were added for septic shock. CVVH was administered for metabolic acidosis and anuria. But poor DLC function was noted so DLC was re-inserted. The blood culture yielded GNB rapidly. Due to frequent hospitalization, Tazocin was upgraded to Mepem empirically.

[Newly-added medication and interventions]
5/5 Start CVVH
5/6 On CVC and DLC, shift Tazocin to Mepem

[Important consultations]

[Important family's decision]
5/7 Husband signed DNR except drug and HD

Plan 
1. Keep Mepem due to profound shock and history of hospitalization recently
2. Keep CVVH and hydration
3. Keep ventilator support for septic shock with GNB bacteremia
4. Inotropic/vasopresser support, taper if feasible
5. May arrange PCN insertion after condition stable
6. Cash PPI use for prevent GI bleeding
7. Inform poor prognosis
