Brief Summary of this week    
Her hemodynamics fluctuated initially but improved gradually. But her distal limbs became cyanosis and gangrene change. Pitressin was tapered off from 5/9. The urine culture yielded Pseudomonas and wild type Enterococcus so Ampicillin was added. Under relatively stable hemodynamics, we consulted Radiologist and bilateral PCN was inserted on 5/11. Pus-like content was drained out from right PCN and the culture also yielded ESBL E.coli. CVVH was tapered off once on 5/12, but dyspnea and hypotension developed in the early morning on 5/13 and the lab data showed relative acidosis so CVVH was resumed. 


Problem Assessment Plan   
          
PAP 1 
Assessment

     B/C(PB): ESBL E.coli, TTP 9.8hr
     U/C: wt PsA>100000, E.faecalis>100000(S to Ampicillin)
5/11 R't PCN: ESBL E.coli 3+, GPC 1+
 
[Ventilator]
PSV, PS 146, PEEP 8, FiO2 35%
=> Vt 360-430, MV 9.5, RR 26, SpO2 99%

[Inotropic/vasopressor]
Levophed 5ml/hr
Pitressin off

[RRT]
5/5-5/12, 5/13- CVVH for metabolic acidosis

[PE]
E4M6Vt, clear consciousness
Chest: crackles, L>R, no wheeze
Heart: tachycardia, no audible murmur
Abdomen: soft, hypoactive BoS, no tenderness
Extremities: edema(+), cyanosis and gangrene change of all limbs(手到手腕上緣，腳到小腿下1/3-1/2)

[Important study findings]
5/6 Bedside echo: bil. hydronephrosis, R>L
5/9 Still bilateral hydronephrosis, liver cyst over S3, S7

[Newly-added medication and interventions]
5/5 Start CVVH
5/6 On CVC and DLC, shift Tazocin to Mepem
5/7 start UF 50ml/hr
5/8 UF 0 (CVVH easily clotted)
5/9 Pitressin off, taper levophed
5/11 Bilateral PCN insertion, drain sent for culture
5/13 early morning off CVVH, but dropped BP and dyspnea
     ->resume CVVH

[Important consultations]

[Important family's decision]
5/7 signed DNR(不電不壓), 不上第三線升壓藥
5/8 explained poor prognosis; informed difficult CVVH (easily clotted) and possible further hypotension ==> could understand

Plan 
1. Keep Mepem for ESBL E.coli bacteremia and PsA UTI, and Ampicillin for U/C: Enterococcus faecalis
2. Keep CVVH for metabolic acidosis and fluid overload. Target Dry BW 50kg
3. Keep ventilator support 
4. Keep PCN drainage
5. Inform grave prognosis
6. Increased enteral nutrition if feasible
