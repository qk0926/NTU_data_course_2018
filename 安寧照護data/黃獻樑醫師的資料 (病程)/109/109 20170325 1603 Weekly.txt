Brief Summary of this week    
Since the hemodynamics became stable, CVVH was switched to iHD since 2017/03/20. The patient was still anuria, so hemodialysis was kept. PTCD revision was performed on 2017/03/21, but poor drainage function was still noted. The level of total bilirubin was still elevating. The level of Hb stablized, and the level of ammonia was also decreased. The patient's consciousness became clear since 2017/03/22. After discussion with his family about the patient's current condition, they preferred palliative care. Extubation would be performed on 2017/03/26 without re-intubation.

[Important patient's and family's decision]
3/17 son: DNR(不壓不電, signed) 
3/18 son: 院宣,但希望能在尚有一口氣時先行更換衣物
3/19 sister:inform critical condition, the potential of liver failure, massive bleeding and septic shock
3/22 son: palliative management if new sepsis developed
3/23 sons: sign DNR全拒, request extubation on W7, stop HD in the hospice ward
3/24 son: wish dry weight first then hold HD?
3/25 son: consider keep H/D after extubation

Plan 
1. for BTI with septic shock and respiratory failure
   - keep Vancomycin; change Mepem to Maxipime; consider Colistin?
   - keep H/D QW135 (set DW 60 kg 2017/03/16)
   - keep ventilator support
   - tapper Solucortef to 25mg Q12H; May DC on 3/27?
2.  For GIB/coaguplophy/shock liver
   - Componant til the goal achieved 
   - keep Nexium IV (Q12H->QD since 3/25)
   - Keep transamine 500mg Q8H->Q12H since 3/25
   - NPO with D50W
   - Start Baraclude from GI OPD蘇東弘
   - Lactulose 60ml Q12H R
3. For seizure
   - Keep Anxican PRN
   - AED use if new seizure episode
   - Consider holding transamin if new seizure
   - Try to correct respiratory alkalosis
4. Inform grave prognosis due to multiple organ failure
   --> son signed DNR全拒
   --> family prefer 院宣 (希望能在尚有一口氣時先行更換衣物)
       hospice combine care(3/18 consulted)
   --> extubation on 3/26. Transfer to hospice ward if stable vital signs, then stop HD(they wish dry weight first then hold?) 
   --> 3/25 son resigned DNR除藥除洗腎
