<3C2 treatment course>
  After he was admitted, ice blanket was performed for ketp BT around 36 degree C. The GCS level was around E1VTM1 to E3VTM4, then we removed the ice blanket on 1/29 7:30. ECG was then performed, and it reorted moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. Month angle twitching and for limbs convulsion was noted since 1/28 night, and keppra loading was then administered. Under the impression of seizure attack, we consulted neurologist, and Keppra infusion with Rivotril was suggested. Bradycarida developed since 1/29, with fluctation BP, so low dose Dopamine was added for support. 

Follow-up EEG was arranged on 2016/02/01, it reported no significant changes nor epileptiform discharge. However, intermittent right facial twitching was noted since 2016/02/02. We contacted with neurologist, and they suggested to increase Rivotril dose to 1# Q6H. Seizure was subsided after then.

[consultation]
1/17 Oncologist: 
     1. Suspect pneumonia with suspected increased bilateral
        pleural effusion, to exclude cancer progression
     2. Altered consciousness, r/o sepsis related first
1/29 Neuro: 
     1. Please increase Keppra to 1000mg q12h.
     2. Please add Rivotril(0.5) 1# q8h.
     3. Please follow-up awake EEG on next W1. 
02/01 Neuro CR­S:
     intermittent right facial twitching -> suspect seizure
     suggest increase Rivotril dose 1# Q6H

[Family's decisions]
1/21    agreed with re-intubation
1/27-28 agreed for therapeutic hypothermia, 
        chest tube if indicated, ­n¿n·¥
1/28    Left upper limb swelling, SVC syndrome related, 
        Inform family the indication of Clexane use and 
        risk of bleeding, Family agree
2/3 family consented to RCC transfer

<Plan>
1. Complete 10-day course of Tazocin
2. For seizure, keep Keppra and rivotril (1# Q6H) for seizure
3. Consider resuming clexane carefully for SVC syndrome if hemosputum subsides. Beware of re-bleeding.   
4. Informed family about poor prognosis and vegetative possibility. Family consented to RCC transfer (probably on 02/06)
