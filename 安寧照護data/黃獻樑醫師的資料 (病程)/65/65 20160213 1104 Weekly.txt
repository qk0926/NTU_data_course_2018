Brief Summary of this week    
<3C2 treatment course>
After he was admitted, ice blanket was performed for ketp BT around 36 degree C. The GCS level was around E1VTM1 to E3VTM4, then we removed the ice blanket on 1/29 7:30. ECG was then performed, and it reorted moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. Month angle twitching and for limbs convulsion was noted since 1/28 night, and keppra loading was then administered. Under the impression of seizure attack, we consulted neurologist, and Keppra infusion with Rivotril was suggested. Bradycarida developed since 1/29, with fluctation BP, so low dose Dopamine was added for support. 

Follow-up EEG was arranged on 2016/02/01, it reported no significant changes nor epileptiform discharge. However, intermittent right facial twitching was noted since 2016/02/02. We contacted with neurologist, and they suggested to increase Rivotril dose to 1# Q6H. Seizure was subsided after then. Due to difficulty in weaning, he was transferred to RCC ward for further managment on 2015/2/6.

<RCC treatment>
After transferred to RCC, pigtail was inserted again because of large amount of right side pleural effusion. Because of poor consciousness, the possiblity of weaning off ventilator is low. We discussed with family about to perform tracheastomy or extubation. And they preferred extubation without intubation again(安寧拔管). But the timing of extubation has not been decided.

[consultation]
1/17 Oncologist: 
     1. Suspect pneumonia with suspected increased bilateral
        pleural effusion, to exclude cancer progression
     2. Altered consciousness, r/o sepsis related first
1/29 Neuro: 
     1. Please increase Keppra to 1000mg q12h.
     2. Please add Rivotril(0.5) 1# q8h.
     3. Please follow-up awake EEG on next W1. 
02/01 Neuro CR范:
     intermittent right facial twitching -> suspect seizure
     suggest increase Rivotril dose 1# Q6H

[Family's decisions]
1/21    agreed with re-intubation
1/27-28 agreed for therapeutic hypothermia, 
        chest tube if indicated, 要積極
1/28    Left upper limb swelling, SVC syndrome related, 
        Inform family the indication of Clexane use and 
        risk of bleeding, Family agree
2/3     family consented to RCC transfer
2/6     family prefer 安寧拔管if weaning failure
2/11    Family prefer extubation again and not reintubation.

Plan 
1. For seizure, keep Keppra and rivotril (1# Q6H)
 -> if poor control, can use dormicum pump or might titrate Rivotril dose 
2. Monitor pigtail drainage amount, might remove if still no much pleural effusion drainage
3. High fat diet since 2/9 due to CO2 retension, watch out diarrhea
4. Informed family about poor prognosis and vegetative 
   possibility. 
-> Family prefer extubation again and not reintubation.
