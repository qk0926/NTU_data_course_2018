Brief Summary of this week    
This week, we kept levophed use for neurogenic shock. Antibiotics was removed, and no fever or other infection signs was noted. FIO2 was kept about 40-50%, and he could tolerate it well. We had a deep discussion with his family, and they decided to remove ETT and inotropic agent by nature course at 2016/2/15 09:00. We would keep tapper Levophed next week and will transfer him to ordinary ward or RCW if stable.
