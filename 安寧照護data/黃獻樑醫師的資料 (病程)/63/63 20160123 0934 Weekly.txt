Brief Summary of this week    
Aftera admission, we consulted nutritionist and adjusted feeding program as their suggestion. We also consulted oncologist VS林 for further chemotherapy, and he suggested follow-up in OPD. However, vomitting and choking was noted on 2016/1/19. Aspiration pneumonia with stridor and desaturation was noted on the next day. Local finding revelaed left vocal cord palsy and right vocal fold paresis, and buldging of posterior pharyngeal wall. Tracheostomy was then performed on 2016/1/20, and he was transferred to ICU for ventilator support. Coffee ground from PEG was noted on the same day, and he was put on NPO and Naxium. He was transferred back to our ward due to improved oxygen demand. No more coffee ground was noted, so oral feeding was started. However, intermittent desaturation was still noted on 2016/1/22, and CXR showed progressive bialteral lung pneumonia. Sputum culture reported Enterobacter aerogenes 3+, so antibiotic was shifted to Maxipime according to the sensitivity report. Anemia and hypokalemia was noted on 2016/1/23, and we gave blood component therapy and KCL support.
