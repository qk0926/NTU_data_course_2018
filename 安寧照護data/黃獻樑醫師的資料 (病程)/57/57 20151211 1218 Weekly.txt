Brief Summary of this week 
During this week, frequent VPC with ST depression and elevated cardiac enzyme were found on 12/4 but due to vital signs stationary, anticoagulant was not suitable. We removed EVD on 12/5. Procalcitonin level was within normal limit. Due to above reasons, we discontinue antibiotics on 12/5. However, BP drop was found on 12/09; therefore, we added antibiotics as Mepem usage. After then, condition gradually improved. We then shifted antibiotics to Tatumcef 1000 mg Q8H usage on 12/11. 

After discussing with family, termination extubation will be performed on 12/12. We will keep monitoring her condition during these days.
