Brief Summary of this week
After admission, we kept hypothermia protocol and close monitoring her fluid status, electrolyte and EKG. H/D was hold due to unstable BP and no emergent H/D indication (there was no fluid overload, no acidosis, azotemia nor hyperkalemia). Depakin was given for suspected GTC and rivotril was then added for myoclonus. Propofol infusion for sedation was prescribed. EEG was arranged on 10/23 which revealed spiking wave. Keppra was then added.
