This 58-year-old man with:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure, suspected neuromuscular disease, complicated with respiratory acidosis and in-hospital cardiac arrest, status post cardiopulmonary resuscitation (14 min) and endotracheal intubation + mechanical ventilation (2015-10-09~11/05), with return of spontaneous circulation
2. Suspected hypoxemic encephalopathy, with coma and seizures
3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia, improved
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (2015-10-05 HbA1c: 7.7%), with suspected neuropathy
6. Hypertension

<Treatment course>
After admitted, poor conscious (E1M1Vt) was still notice. Emperical Ceftazidime was kept for suspect HAP. EEG was arranged on 2015/10/13 and reveals nearly no discernible cortical activities. Grave neurologis prognosis was informed to his family and they preffered withdraw the ventilation but need time let more family members came to see the patient. The patient's conscious mild improving to E2M2-3Vt then stasis again. Mild fever with increase sputum was noticed on 2015/10/19. Following CxR showed newly RLL patch, Brosyn was emperical added for VAP after septic work up. Although later the sputum culture yield MRSA and ESBL. K.P, antibiotics not adjusted due to the clinical condition was improving. We completed Abx treatment 2015/10/28. Transient hematuria without obstruction was notice and compoment therapy was given. The patient's consicous still no obvious improving. After well discussed with the patient's family, we consult family medicine VS姚建安 for withdraw protocol.
The patient had pass spontaneous breathing trial, thus we had done extubation on 11/05. There was no stridor, only intermittent desaturation was noted, we keep supportive care and prepare for general ward transfer.
