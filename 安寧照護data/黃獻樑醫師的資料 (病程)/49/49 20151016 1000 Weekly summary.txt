Brief Summary of this week    
However, septic shock was noted after right DBJ insertion. Levophed was administered for about 1 day. Tazocin was prescribed as emperic use. Blood culture then showed Serratia, so we adjusted antibiotics to Claforan. Clinical condition was improving with decreasing T.bil level. However, still much PTCD drain amount with little oral intake. IV fluid supplement was kept. After discussing with patient and family, EUS-FNA will be performed next week.
