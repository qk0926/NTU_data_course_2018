Brief Summary of this week    
Adequate urine output was observed, and her renal function was improving as well. Levophed was tapered off on 11/09. High O2 demand and ventilator setting were still needed, and rapid shallow breathing pattern was observed during daily interruption of sedation. Family meeting was held on 11/11, and her family preferred to try weaning if her condition became stable. NG feeding was tried, but hypotension developed since 11/11 evening. Levophed was added back, and breakthrough fever was noted at 11/12 night. Septic work-up was repeated, and Mepem was shifted to Cravit to cover Stenotrophomonas maltophilia according to previous pleural effusion culture. Her general condition deteriorated with decreased urine output, increased total bilirubin level and worsened renal function. Dismal outcome had been informed to her family, and the treatment goal had been changed to palliative care. 

Problem Assessment Plan 1
Assessment 
Cravit D2 (11/13-), pleural effusion: SM
Daptomycin D22 (10/24-), VRE sepsis
Micafungin D20 (10/26-), Ascites: C. tropicalis
--------------------------------
Tazocin 10/9-10/12, 10/23-10/24
Claforan 10/12-10/23
Targocid 10/23-10/24
Diflucan 10/25
Mepem 10/24-11/12

[Ventilator settings]
PCV, IP 24, PEEP 8, RR 30, FiO2 60%
=> Vt: 250, ftot 42, MV 7.7, SpO2 95%
=> decreased tidal volume

Diet: NPO + TPN 1100ml QD + lipofundin 250ml QOD

[Physical examination]
Cons: E1M1Vt, under sedation
BS: diffuse crackles, prominent over the right side
Heart: RHB, no audible murmur
BoS: hypoactive BoS
Abdomen: distended
Extremity: grade II~III pitting edema

[Important Study findings]
9/28 Abdominal CT: s/p gastrojejunostomy; Suspected gastric lesion, Mild swelling of the pancreatic head, Wall-thickening of CBD with dilated biliary tree; Right hydronephrosis; Nodular infiltration of the omentum, suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis
10/1  ERCP: one 1.5cm polypoid leison at anastomosis site 
      s/p biopsy => polypoid gastritis
      Only orifice of anturm to pylorus can be seen 
      but scope can't pass through it
10/19 EUS-FNA: Gastric wall thickness cytology: suspicious adenocarcinoma; biopsy: only clot fibrin
      Ascites cytology: adenocarcinoma, metastatic
10/23 Abd. CT: Suspected wall-thickening at gastric antrum. Mild swelling of the pancreatic head; dilatation of biliary tree. Placement of a CBD stent; Mild right hydronephrosis. Placement of a right ureteral stent; Nodular infiltration of the omentum, suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis; New bilateral pleural effusion, more on left side. Ascites, Pericardial effusion.
10/23 L’t thoracentesis: green color => highly suspected bile leak induced peritonitis and pleural effusion
11/09 bedside chest echo: mild Rt pleural effusion (2cm in depth, 2 ICS)

[Important Interventions and Newly Added Medications]
10/2 PTCD for obstructive jaundice
10/7 Antegrade biliary stent => 10/12 stent revision
10/8 Right DBJ insertion for right hydronephrosis
10/22 Remove PTCD due to fair internal stent function
10/24 ETT + MV, right femoral CVC insertion
10/25 Pigtail, left for pleural effusion
10/26 try iNO for ARDS (1PM)
10/29 off iNO
11/04 Shift PTN to D50W, Rasitol 20mg Q6H
11/09 DC rasitol
11/12 Breakthrough fever-->work up, shift Mepem to Cravit

[Important Consultation and Meeting Suggestions]
10/24 GI鄭: 1) Stabilized hemodynamic status first, arrange PTCD placement after vital sign stabilized(Scheduled on 10/26) 2) NPO with IV nutrition support
10/27 FM for hospice combined care

[Important Family Decisions]
10/24 Family: agreed on cash PPI and PTCD
10/26 Family signed DNR 除藥院宣, 兩種升壓藥
11/02 Family re-signed DNR, 不洗腎
11/04 discussed with her family, and they agreed Levophed upper limit 20ml/hr
11/06 Still hoped vasopressor if needed
11/09 Family accept RCC transfer
11/10 Family (5th son hoped another family meeting)
11/14 Family: palliative care
Plan 
1. keep current antibiotics, no more adjustment
   Pursue culture report
2. Keep TPN and lipofundin, NPO except drugs
3. Inform grave prognosis to all family members
4. Palliative and hospice combined care
5. Pain control with fentanyl patch and IV form
