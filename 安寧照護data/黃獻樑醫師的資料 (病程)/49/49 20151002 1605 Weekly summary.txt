[Diagnosis]
1. Gastric antrum tumor, complicated with bile duct, right ureter obstruction, and suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis s/p failed ERCP on 2015/10/01, s/p PTCD on 2015/10/02
2. Macrocytic anemia
3. Hand crush injury, left wrist, status post operation

[Treatment course]
  After admission, we initiated parenteral nutrition due to poor intake. Intraductal sonography(IDUS), ERCP, ERBD and biopsy was arranged on 2015/10/01 for tissue proof and bile drainage. Orthopedic doctor was also consulted for change dressing of left wrist crush injury wound. However, one 1.5cm polypoid leison was noted at anastomosis site s/p biopsy. Only orifice of anturm to pylorus can be seen but scope can't pass through it. We arranged PTCD for obstructive jaundice first then consider antegrade brushing/CBD biopsy or try to dilate antrum on 10/2. Urologist was consulted for right hydronephrosis. PRBC 1U was transfused for anemia(Hb:7.8). We will check folic acid and Vit B12 level. 

[Assessment]
GCS E4V5M6, ECOG 1
Head: mild pale conjunctivae, icteric sclerae
Chest: bilateral clear brething sound
Abdomen: soft, normoactive bowel sound, no tenderness
Limbs: edema(-)

<Important Study Findings>
09/28 CT Gastric antrum wall swelling with bile duct, right ureter, and peritoneal involvement
09/30 CEA(4.29), CA-199

<Important Intervention and Newly Added medication>
10/01 ERCP, IDUS, ERBD, biopsy: Failed due to previous gastrojejunosotmy and only orifice of anturm to pylorus can be seen but scope can't pass through it.
10/02 PTCD

<Important consultation>
10/02 Urologist for Right hydronephrosis

<Important family's decision>

[Plan]
1. For gastric antrum tumor, with bile duct, right ureter obstruction.
   => Monitor PTCD color and amount
   => Pursue CA199 result
   => Consult Uro for DBJ for right hydronephrosis
   => Repeat EGD with digging biopsy or biopsy after bougination

2. For macrocytic anemia
   => Blood transfusion as necessary
   => Check Folic acid, Vit B12
