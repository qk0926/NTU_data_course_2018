Brief Summary of this week    
Please also refer to on-service note.
After tranasferring to general ward, EEG f/u (2 weeks post CPR) was done. It showed isoeletric tracing without any responses to the alerting maneuvers, which was compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy.

[Assessment]
1/07 OHCA(PEA) s/p CPR 26 min, with ROSC
1/07 Brain CT: r/o HIE change
1/07 Sputum culture: K.p. & Ps.a
1/08 EEG: intermittent episodic independently laterlized or generalized rhythmic or semi-rhythmic theta waves at 4-5 Hz, 40-60 uV in either hemisphere against a nearly electrosilent background. 
1/20 CXR: improved
1/20 EEG: isoeletric tracing without any responses to the alerting maneuvers. compatible with hypoxic encephalopathy.

Plan 
DNR(+)
1. Complete meropenem treatment course for pneumonia
2. Keep ventilator support
3. Monitor I/O balance
4. Consider arrange brain perfusion SPECT for prognosis
5. Still poor prognosis was infomred. Await for further disposition when condition stable. His wife preferred to keep current management now. Hospice care might be considered after the Chinese New Year.
