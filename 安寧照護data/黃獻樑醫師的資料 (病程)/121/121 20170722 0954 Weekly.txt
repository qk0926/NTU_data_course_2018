1) Right lower pneumonia, with respiratory failure and shock, status post ETT+MV (6/25-), being treated with Piperacillin/tazobactam and then cefepime (7/6-7/20)
2) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with onset in 2015, diagnosed in 2016
3) hypertension

[Treatment course]
    The patient decided withdrawal and the family respected his decision. A psychiatrsit was consulted to rule out depression and he replied: "病人目前決策非受重大精神疾病影響，非屬完全無行為能力者，建議依照一般臨床準則評估末期狀態及維生系統使用與撤除合理性。" 倫理委員會評估此案只要有兩位專科醫師認定為末期，即無法律或倫理爭議。
    Tramal IV drips could ameliorate his discomfort. Imovane helped him fall asleep.
    Cefepime (7/6-20) was completed.

[Plan]
1) For RLL pneumonia
- Piperacillin/tazobactam -> cefepime (7/6-20)
- Keep VC/AC ventilator support
- Chest care
  
2) For ALS
- Keep current medication
- Try adequate analgesics

3) 
- Adjust Tramal to try morphine if the patient wants
- 給親友一週的時間來探望病人，之後進行Withdrawal
  似乎要等到7/27之後
  May contact hospice ward (transfer after extubation??)
- DNR 意願書已給
- Family meeting on W2
