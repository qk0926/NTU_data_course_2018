1) Right lower pneumonia, with respiratory failure and shock, status post ETT+MV (6/25-), being treated with Piperacillin/tazobactam and then cefepime (7/6-)
2) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with onset in 2015, diagnosed in 2016
3) hypertension

[Treatment course]
    After admission, Maxipime was given for pneumonia. Fasciculation improved after titration of Trileptal and Befon both to 1# Q12H. The patient complained of numbness and tingling sensation of 4 limbs, especially thighs, refractory to medication but responsive to massage. 
    His pneumonia improved. Weaning started but he could not tolerate CPAP more than 1 hour. VC remained around 500 ml.

[Plan]
1) For RLL pneumonia
- Piperacillin/tazobactam -> cefepime (7/6-)
- Slow weaning
- Chest care
- Record vital capacity regularly
  
2) For ALS
- Keep Rilutek (currently still not ventilator dependent)
- 不做PEG 
- Rivotril for leg cramps
  Trileptal and Lyrica for numbness/tingling
  家屬自備肢體按摩器
  If no improvement, DC Lyrica

3) Eurodin 1.5# HS for insomnia

4) The patient refused further tracheostomy. He preferred withdrawal
    Consult hospice for evaluation of withdrawal
