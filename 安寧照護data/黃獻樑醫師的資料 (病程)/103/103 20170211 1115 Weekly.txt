Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, we initiate TTM. Under no sedation, the patient was still in deep coma. Pupil was 8-/8-, and there was no brainstem reflex. TTM was completed with correctable electrolyte imbalance.
 CT-Angio and perfusion on 1/29 revealed very poor perfusion, favor IICP related. Bedside carotid duplex also showed reverse diastolic flow of the left VA and left CCA. Hyperosmolarity State, with hypernatremia and hyperglycemia, suspected due to osmotic diuresis (Mannitol) was found. We added back free H2O deficit based on daily fluid status, but poor response to reduce serum sodium level. We suspected central diabetes insipidus, and checked 24h urine osmolality while added Minirin 2 puff BID since 2/6. 

ID man suggested Ampicillin and Gentamicin from 4-8 weeks for Listeria CNS infection and CSF culture seem to be essential to determined suscessful treatment. She had ND (near jejunum) tube insertion due to very poor digestion. EEG on 2/7 interpreted a probable electrocerebral silence. SPECT on 2/8 showed no definite perfusion in bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, including upper brainstem, which compatible with brain death. There was suspected new episoded of sepsis shock presented with hypothermia and hypotension, We shifted Cravit to Sevatrim based on sputum culture drug susceptibility for Burkholderia and sternotrophomonas. We informed family brain death and current ongoing infection. We added solucortef for suspected pan-hypopituitarism.
