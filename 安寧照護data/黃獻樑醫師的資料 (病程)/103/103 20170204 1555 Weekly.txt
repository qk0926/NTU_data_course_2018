Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, we initiate TTM. Under no sedation, the patient was still in deep coma. Pupil was 8-/8-, and there was no brainstem reflex. TTM was completed with correctable electrolyte imbalance.
 CT-Angio and perfusion on 1/29 revealed very poor perfusion, favor IICP related. Bedside carotid duplex also showed reverse diastolic flow of the left VA and left CCA. Hyperosmolarity State, with hypernatremia and hyperglycemia, suspected due to osmotic diuresis (Mannitol) was found. We added back free H2O deficit based on daily fluid status, but poor response to reduce serum sodium level. Thus, we suspected central diabetes insipidus, we checked 24h urine osmolality while added Minirin 2 puff BID. ID specialist will confirmed duration of antibiotics use in immunocompromised patients with CNS Listeria infection next week.
