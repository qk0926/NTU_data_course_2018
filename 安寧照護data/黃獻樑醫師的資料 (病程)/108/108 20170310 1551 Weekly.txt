1. upper GI bleeding, status post PES: oozing, under somatostatin, nexium, APC. anemia persists, suspected lower GI bleeding, refractory UGI bleeding, hemolysis, uremic bleeding
2. normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, suspected due to CKD

Plan 
1. keep maxipime, may DC after leukocytosis resolves, >14 days, CXR: patch resolvs
2. NPO
3. follow up for Hb, Ca, P, Mg level, keep Hb >7
4. add furosemide if fluid overload signs worsens and BP is normal/hypertension
