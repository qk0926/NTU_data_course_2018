Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, we tapper off Levophed soon due to normotensive blood pressure and had adequet urinary output. ventilator showed low tidal volumn under relative high inhale pressure (IP:20, Tv:200), favor restrictive lung, lung compliance was around 10, favored tumor pleural seeding related. Diagnostic thoracenesis was performed at the right side and only 75ml pleural effusion drained out. Tazocin was given for suspected intra-abdominal infection, NPO was started due to NG showed coffee-ground and tarry stool from colostomy, Nexium was given. For elevated lipase, we followed lipase for suspect pancreatitis and showed decreasing trend. Feeding was started since 05/14 and no further bleeding recorded.
    For he had passed weanign parameter and tolerated T-piece trial twice, extubation was done on 05/17 10:00, but soon failed at 14:00 and was re-intubated. Poor weaning potentional had informed to the family. Fever and leukocytosis was noticed at 05/19, favored aspiration pneumonia, Abx was shifted to Tienam for infection control, and fever subsided. After discuss with the family, the prefer for withdraw ventilator and critical discharge.

<Important intervention and newly added medication>
5/14 Tarry stool stopped, try diet
5/15 Tolerate T-piece well, no more tarry stool, tolerate diet well
5/17 Extubation but reintubation after 3 hours
5/18 Family still hesitate for tracheostomy creation, favor BiPAP use after extubation

<Important consultation>

<Important family decision>
5/15 Family agree for reintubation if failure for extubation
5/16 Family need to discuss for tracheostomy --> try extubation first
5/19 Family favored extubation without re-intubation (explained DNR)
5/21 Family favor撤除, then discharge under critical condition.

Plan 
1. Keep Tienam use for suspected HAP, pursue culture result(5/18)
2. Consider RCC transfer for poor weaning potential
3. Family favored extubation without re-intubation; pursue DNR status
