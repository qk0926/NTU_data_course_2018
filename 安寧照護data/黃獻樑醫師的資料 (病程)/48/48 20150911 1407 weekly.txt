Brief Summary of this week After transfer to 4A2, follow-up brain CT showed malposition of V-P shunt. V-P shunt revision was performed on 9/5. The acid fast stain of intra-op CSF was all negative. Therefore, localized abdominal TB infection was suggested and HERZ therapy might be at least 6 months. Her conscious remain E1M4VT and focal seizure over left shoulder and leg were noted under AEDs. EEG was performed on 9/9 and showed moderate diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis on the right side. We discontinued depakine due to improved seizure frequency. We kept weaning ventilator and informed her family of tracheostomy next Monday if difficult weaning.

Problem Assessment Plan1. 
V-P shunt dysfunction with abdominal fluid accumulation, complicated with hydrocephalus, s/p CT guided aspiration and VP shunt revision; complicated with TB infection in ascites and CSF, with V-P shunt malposition, status post revision on 2015/9/5 
2. Non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, EGFR exon 18-21 WT, with brain, liver, bone, LN metastasis, status post left occipital craniotomy and tumor resection on 2015/2/9 at CGMH, status post VP shunt operation, status post WBRT (30Gy/10fr) in 2015/3, status post port-A implantation on 2015/3/2, status post chemotherapy with Cisplatin (60mg/m2)+ Alimta (500mg/m2) C1D1=2015/3/27
3. IICP, under steroid treatment (Dorison 1/2# BID), improved

Assessment 
Afebrile, E1M4VT
RUE 0, RLE 0, LUE 2, LLE 1-2
HERZ
CPAP--> RR 29-55
Previous seizure episode (¥ªªÓ»H+¤â©â°Ê) for several times, under Depakine and Keppra--> increased Depakine due to low serum level
--> decreased frequency, DC Depakine
EEG: moderate diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis on the right side

Plan 
1. Keep HERZ; give vitamin B6 to prevent peripheral neuropathy by isoniazid
2. Post-op care
3. F/U liver function and uric acid for HERZ use
4. Weaning ventilator, consider tracheostomy next Monday if difficult weaning
