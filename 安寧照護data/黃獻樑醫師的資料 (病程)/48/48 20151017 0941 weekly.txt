Brief Summary of this week 
<10/11-10/17>
The patient was kept on supportive care with mechanical ventilation and external CPAP trial. Weaning was tolerated and titrated up. Breakthrough fever was noticed on 10/10 afternoon with septic workup done. Empirical antibiotic Mepem was given as titration. Intermittent low grade fever without obvious vital sign change was noticed. Antibiotic was shifted from Mepem to Cravit according to new sputum culture result on 10/13. The patient had breakthorugh fever noticed on 10/15 night with septic workup was done. Home ventilator was kept in use since 10/15. Home care training was prepared and discharge prepare would be done.

[Diet] 調整配方 1750Kcal/1750cc/day, add salt 10g

[Important Progress]
10/06 Exteranl C-PAP 1 hr tolerated with RR around 35bpm, much stool passage in the morning of 1500, s/p LR 1L for keep I/O balance
10/07 Exteranl C-PAP 2 hr QD tolerated but mild fatigue noticed without desaturation
10/08 ECPAP kept. 2 hr BID.
      Tachycardia up to 130/min at 21:30, sinus rhythm from the monitor, no desaturation, RR ~30, but no severe respiratory distress, no fever
       => resume RR(set) 2->10->6->4->2
10/09 ECPAP 4 hr QD. Avoid frequent change of ventilation mode
10/10 ECPAP 4hr BID, fever again, repeated septic workup, changed to Meropenem impirically, WBC:13.45k(Seg:83.9%), LA:2.52, Na:133(diet add salt 5g), Mg:0.63(add MgSO2 32mEq)

10/12 ECPAP 12hr QD, low grade fever still, with tachypnea
10/13 ECPAP 16hr QD, S/C Chryseobacterium indologenes 2+, change to Cravit
10/14 ECPAP 20hr QD, test home ventilator setting, add Apresoline 1# BID for hypertension, LA:1.19, CRP:7.67, Cr:0.2, Hb:8.8, WBC:11.02k, CXR:improved LLL infiltration
10/15 add home ventilator VCSMIV(Vt:500, RR:2, PS:8, PEEP:5), improved shallow breathing pattern after use of home ventilators
10/16 Septic workup on 10/15 night for fever

Plan 
1. Keep HERZ(D47) for TB peritonitis, monitor side effects.
2. Keep Cravit (D5) for S/C Chryseobacterium indologenes 2+ and AB(WT); 
3. ECPAP with home ventilator use.
=> keep OBS and prolong ECPAP time if tolerated.
4. Help disposition finding (home care prefer)
5. Inform poor prognosis and neurological outcome

Assessment 
[Important studies]
09/09 EEG: moderate diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis on the right side.

[Image]
09/03 Brain CT: s/p VP shunt placement with its tip in right frontal cranial fossa; hydrocephalus; old insults.

[Culture]
08/10 Abdominal fluid accumulation aspirate culture: TB
08/31 U/C: yeast 2000
09/06 U/C: yeast 50000
09/22 S/C: AB1+(WT), B/C: negative
09/26 B/Cx2(PB), S/C(S/S: GQ, no bacteria, AB1+(WT)), U/C
10/01 U/C:Yeast-like organism 25000
      S/C:Acinetobacter baumannii 2+ 
          Burkholderia cepacia complex 2+
      B/Cx2(PB): negative
10/10 U/C:negative
      S/C:Chryseobacterium indologenes 2+
          Acinetobacter baumannii 2+ 
      B/Cx2(PB): negative
10/15 Septic workup: pending

[Important intervention or newly added medication]
08/10 CT-guide abdominal fluid accumulation drainage(75-80ml)
09/01 HERZ(No steroid use due to active infection and VP shunt(+))
09/16 Tracheostomy
10/01 Brosym
10/10 Meropenem
10/13 Cravit

[Important consultation]
9/25 ID: No need for steroid use for suspected TB meningitis at this time point
9/25 NS: no need for further brain image at this point, the hydrocephalus was less likely the cause of conscious change. The underline cancer progression was impressed. VP shunt revision also not indicated for TB infection.
9/25 Dr.何肇基: chemotherapy was not suitbale for her

[Important family decision]
10/01 Daughter prefer RCW in 桃園
10/04 Daughter asked about how many days left before transfer?
10/08 Family prefer home care, consult RT for possible home ventilator use.
10/14 Customize home ventilator testing
