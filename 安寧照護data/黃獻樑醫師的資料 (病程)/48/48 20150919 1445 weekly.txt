Brief Summary of this weWe tried weaning ventilator gradually. Tracheostomy was performed smoothly on 9/16. Post-op condition was fine. We had contacted RCC for further disposition.ek 

Problem Assessment Plan 1
1. V-P shunt dysfunction with abdominal fluid accumulation, complicated with hydrocephalus, s/p CT guided aspiration and VP shunt revision; complicated with TB infection in ascites and CSF, with V-P shunt malposition, status post revision on 2015/9/5, status post tracheostomy on 2015/9/16 
2. Non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, EGFR exon 18-21 WT, with brain, liver, bone, LN metastasis, status post left occipital craniotomy and tumor resection on 2015/2/9 at CGMH, status post VP shunt operation, status post WBRT (30Gy/10fr) in 2015/3, status post port-A implantation on 2015/3/2, status post chemotherapy with Cisplatin (60mg/m2)+ Alimta (500mg/m2) C1D1=2015/3/27
3. IICP, under steroid treatment (Dorison 1/2# BID), improved
