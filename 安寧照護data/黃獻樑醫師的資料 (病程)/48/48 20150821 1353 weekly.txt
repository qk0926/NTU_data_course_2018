Brief Summary Intermmitent fever has persisted since 8/15. We no infection focus was found and blood culture on 8/15 was negative. We kept empiric antibiotics. Several days of hypokalemia was noted, and back to normal range after K+ supplement. Follow-up CT on 8/17 showed no subdural or other intracranial hemorrhage and same size of ventricles compared to pre-op. Shunt revision will be performed if no more fever because of the slow rebound of the reservoir.
