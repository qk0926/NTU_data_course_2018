Problem Assessment Plan 2
[Important studies]
09/09 EEG: moderate diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis on the right side.

[Image]
09/03 Brain CT: s/p VP shunt placement with its tip in right frontal cranial fossa; hydrocephalus; old insults.

[Culture]
08/10 Abdominal fluid accumulation aspirate culture: TB
08/31 U/C: yeast 2000
09/06 U/C: yeast 50000
09/22 S/C: AB1+(WT), B/C: negative
09/26 B/Cx2(PB), S/C(S/S: GQ, no bacteria, AB1+(WT)), U/C
10/01 U/C:Yeast-like organism 25000
      S/C:Acinetobacter baumannii 2+

[Important intervention or newly added medication]
08/10 CT-guide abdominal fluid accumulation drainage(75-80ml)

10/01 Brosym
10/10 Meropenem
10/13 Cravit
10/20 Morphine for respiratory alkalosis
10/21 Cravit to Mepem

[Important consultation]
9/25 ID: No need for steroid use for suspected TB meningitis at this time point
9/25 NS: no need for further brain image at this point, the hydrocephalus was less likely the cause of conscious change. The underline cancer progression was impressed. VP shunt revision also not indicated for TB infection.
9/25 Dr.何肇基: chemotherapy was not suitbale for her
10/21 Dr.何: palliative care for the patient's terminal cancer status.
10/22 Consult hospice for family consider withdraw.

[Important family decision]
10/01 Daughter prefer RCW in 桃園
10/04 Daughter asked about how many days left before transfer?
10/08 Family prefer home care, consult RT for possible home ventilator use.
10/14 Customize home ventilator testing
10/21 The family would like ventilator withdrawal
10/24 Family accompany the patient after withdrawal
