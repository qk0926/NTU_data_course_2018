Brief Summary of this week 
<10/04-10/10>
Mechanical ventilation and T-piece trial with antibiotic Brosym treatment were kept over the weekend. The patient tried T piece but failed with extreme tachypnea. Low tidal volume was noticed with echo found poor diaphragm motility. The patient tried External CPAP(7.5) 1 hour on 10/06 and tolerated well. ECPAP trial was kept on uptitration to 2hour QD, rapid and shallow breathing pattern was noticed without desaturation or tachycardia on 10/07. Mild dyspnea with increased RR noticed on 10/08 night, workup was done and showed stationary result and further observation and followup kept. The patient kept on ECPAP training on 10/09. Mild low grade fever was noticed. Breakthrough fever upto 38 degree was noticed on 10/10 afternoon. Septic workup was done. Further ECPAP training and treatment for possible infection would be kept.

[Diet] 調整配方 1750Kcal/1750cc/day

[Important Progress]
9/25 start T-P 2hr BID; RR 30-40, parodoxical pattern
still low grade fever, poor consciousness
9/26 fever to 38'C; U/A: WBC 5-10/HPF, S/S: GQ, no bacteria
-> Add Ceftazidime for susp VAP
-> still left shoulder involuntary movement under Keppra 1000mg BID
9/27 Tachycardia w/ HR~120 -> switch back to PCV
TV 200->500ml under IP 16; RR 30->20
9/28 low TV, auto-PEEP under SIMV(4)
9/29 Procalcitonin=0.19
9/30 Adjust SIMV(2->6), T-P 8hr QD
** Bedside echo: no ascites or obvious pleural effusion
** Lung cancer related bilateral phrenic nerve palsy?
10/01 new onset fever, septic workup, change to Brosym
10/03 Bedside echo: poor diaphragm movement, suspected phrenic nerve palsy
10/04 Try T-piece 2hr BID with RR>40
10/05 T-piece 2hr QD failure due to RR>40, improved consciousness to E4VtM5, vomiting once with poor digestion of NG 200ml, Lab:UA:5.6, ALT:53, Mg:0.63 s/p supplement, Hb:8.9, PLT:238, WBC:9.02
10/06 Exteranl C-PAP 1 hr tolerated with RR around 35bpm, much stool passage in the morning of 1500, s/p LR 1L for keep I/O balance
10/07 Exteranl C-PAP 2 hr QD tolerated but mild fatigue noticed without desaturation
10/08 ECPAP kept. 2 hr BID.
      Tachycardia up to 130/min at 21:30, sinus rhythm from the monitor, no desaturation, RR ~30, but no severe respiratory distress, no fever
       => resume RR(set) 2->10->6->4->2
10/09 ECPAP 4 hr QD. Avoid frequent change of ventilation mode
10/10 ECPAP 4hr BID, fever again, repeated septic workup.

[Important studies]
09/09 EEG: moderate diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis on the right side.

[Image]
09/03 Brain CT: s/p VP shunt placement with its tip in right frontal cranial fossa; hydrocephalus; old insults.

Plan
1. Keep HERZ(D40) for TB peritonitis, monitor side effects.
2. Keep Brosym (D10) empirically for susp VAP(S/C=AB); keep short course if non-toxic(7-10 days by Dr.王振泰); monitor PT/APTT if any bleeding signs, consider changing abx for new fever noticed.
3. Increased RR(set) to 10, pending lab data, may taper later, and consider keeping 4hr QD on 10/10 if stable, or prolong TP time.
=> keep OBS and prolong ECPAP time if tolerated.
4. Help disposistion finding (home care prefer)
5. Inform poor prognosis and neurological outcome.

Problem Assessment Plan 2
[Culture]
08/10 Abdominal fluid accumulation aspirate culture: TB
08/31 U/C: yeast 2000
09/06 U/C: yeast 50000
09/22 S/C: AB1+(WT), B/C: negative
09/26 B/Cx2(PB), S/C(S/S: GQ, no bacteria, AB1+(WT)), U/C
10/01 U/C:Yeast-like organism 25000
      S/C:Acinetobacter baumannii 2+ 
          Burkholderia cepacia complex 2+
      B/Cx2(PB): negative
10/10 Septic workup: pending

[Important intervention or newly added medication]
08/10 CT-guide abdominal fluid accumulation drainage(75-80ml)
09/01 HERZ(No steroid use due to active infection and VP shunt(+))
09/16 Tracheostomy

[Important consultation]
9/25 ID: No need for steroid use for suspected TB meningitis at this time point
9/25 NS: no need for further brain image at this point, the hydrocephalus was less likely the cause of conscious change. The underline cancer progression was impressed. VP shunt revision also not indicated for TB infection.
9/25 Dr.何肇基: chemotherapy was not suitbale for her

[Important family decision]
10/01 Daughter prefer RCW in 桃園
10/04 Daughter asked about how many days left before transfer?
10/08 Family prefer home care, consult RT for possible home ventilator use.
