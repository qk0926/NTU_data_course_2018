Brief Summary of this week    
This 38-year-old woman was admitted because of HIE, and no brainstem reflex was noted.
    Intermittent polyuria and hypernatremia were noted after Mannitol administration. Her urine output abruptly decreased after Minirin infusion. Hydration with D5W or lactate ringer was given for decreasing serum Na. Hypotension and desaturation developed on 11/3, and chest X-ray showed bilateral lower lung atelectasis. Low grade fever was also noted. We suspected her as having pneumonia due to absent cough reflex and lung collapse, empirical antibiotic with Tazocin was given since 11/4.
    We also discussed with her family about poor neurological outcome, and explained the pros and cons of either long-term care or withdrawal of ventilator. Since her vital signs were merely maintained under intensive medical care, her family decided to choose withdrawal of ventilator in the near future.
