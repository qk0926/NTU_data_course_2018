 -> may lower the dose if progression of renal failure

   (goal pCO2 30–35 mmHg) (Stroke 2013;44:870-947)
2. Informed poor neurological outcome to her family (parents and husband), his husband signed DNR permit (不電不壓除藥)
 -> informed possible sudden death due to compression to brainstem

3. correct electrolyte imbalance and control I/O
 -> PRN ddAVP for DI
4. keep current NG trickle feeding 5ml/hr, titrate as tolerated
 -> elemental diet for poor digestion
    aminofluid 1000ml/day as supportive IVF; goal: 1000kcal/day
5. solu-cortef 50mg Q12H for adrenal insufficiency
 -> midodrine 25mg 1# bid, titrate to keep SBP
 -> add Eltroxin 100mcg 0.5# qd for hypothyroidism
6. may increase the PEEP for atelectasis if desaturation

RT :
<Plan>
