Brief Summary of this week    
This week, his vital signs remained stable. Urine culture revealed Candida albicans and Diflucan was added on 2016/08/18. However, followed CXR on 2016/08/22 revealed mild increased RLL patch. Mild drowsiness was also noted. Thus, septic workup was repeated, and Tazocin was administered since 2016/08/23. Foley was removed on 2016/08/24, and the urine output was acceptable.

<Family Decision>
1. DNR (不電不壓不TAE,除藥到家屬來)
   --> 已向小女兒說明有時狀況緊急,並無法等待,等待一天實屬不太可能
2. Hesitated about panendoscopy and colonscopy
   preferred medicaine treatment

Plan 
1. keep Tazocin, and oral form Diflucan
   monitor clinical conditions and vital signs
   consider stopping Cortisone 1# Q12H if relative stable hemodynamics 
2. f/u blood test QW1,4 (next time: 8/29)
3. High dose Pantoloc 
   Transamin IF use
   component therapy!
4. NPO except drug 
   NG decompression + Primperan + Bisacodyl R
   TPN use
5. Family decision: DNR (不電不壓不TAE,除藥到家屬來,大約要一天...)(大姊、二哥、小妹)
   Hospice combined care.
   as the family refused panendoscopy exam, we closely monitor GI bleeding condition and kept high dose PPI
6. change tracheostomy today due to rupture of cuff of BIOVONA
    --> possible cause: (1) cuff打太飽-->壓力測起來ok
                        (2) 產品瑕疵--> 但其他病人均無此狀況
                        (3) 病人欲講話,喉嚨用力使cuff破裂 -->??
