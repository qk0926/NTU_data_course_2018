Brief Summary of this week    
This week, hypotension with hypothermia developed on 2016/08/02, and thus, septic workup was done. Tazocin was added empirically, and Levophed was also ministered. Blood culture from CVC yielded GPC, so the CVC was changed. Inotropic agent taperred gradually, and the final result of blood culture(*2 sets) showed Burkholderia cepacia complex. After discussion with ID specialist, Tazocin was switched to Meropenem on 2016/08/05.
 However, bloody stool was noted since 2016/08/03. Component therapy with pRBC and FFP was done, and the dosage of transamine was increased. The critical condition was informed to the patient's family(daughter, daughter-in-law), and his daughter conformed the content of DNR.

<Family Decision>
1. DNR (不電不壓不TAE,除藥到家屬來)
2. Hesitated about panendoscopu and colonscopy
   preferred medicaine treatment
Plan 
1. levophed 2ml/hr(16mg in D5W 250ml)
   keep Vancomycin and adequate hydration 
   switch Tazocin to Mepem on 8/5
   monitor clinical conditions and vital signs
   consider stopping Cortisone 1# Q12H if relative stable hemodynamics 
   pursue the culture results and CVC tip culture result
2. f/u blood test QW1,4 (next time: 8/8)
   f/u CBC on 8/6
3. High dose Pantoloc 
   Transamin IF use
   component therapy!
4. NPO except drug 
   NG decompression + Primperan + Bisacodyl R
   TPN use
5. Family decision: DNR (不電不壓不TAE,除藥到家屬來,大約要一天...)(大姊、二哥、小妹)
6. Hospice combined care.
7. hold Lasix 20 mg IV Q12H and monitor I/O
8. keep Fluitran
9. as the family refused panendoscopy exam, we closely monitor GI bleeding condition and kept high dose PPI 
10. inform family about the unstable hemodynamics
