Brief Summary of this week    
After transferring to our general ward, the patient developed fever spike to 38 Celcius degree on 2016/07/09. Septic work-up was done, including blood culture from CVP, DL and peripheral, fungus culture, sputum culture and urine culture. CXR showed left plerual effusion, moderate. Empirical targocid was added (combined with Meropenem use). Urine culture grew yeast-like pathogen, but he defervesced after Abx use. Therefore, we kept Targocid and Meropenem use. 

For GI bleeding, coffee ground event happened during last weekend. We check NG OB and it resulted 4+. We hold NG feeding and kept IV PPI and IV transamine use. Coffee ground subsided gradually. We slowly resumed his NG feeding. Currently, He was under half-milk 1200 ml daily with TPN 1000 ml QD nutrition supplement. No coffee ground or tarry stool was noted.
