Brief Summary of this week    
<4B2 2016/10/03->
Continuous PPI infusion, Mepem + colistin + teicoplanin + micafungin, and Levophed was continued. Tarry stool persisted, and we had him NPO with aminofluid 1000 ml/day. Air leak was noted, therefore the Bivona was changed to low-pressure on 10/04. However, during the changing process, several old blood clots were evacuated from the tracheostomy opening. Bronchoscopy was prepared stand-by for airway inspection, but the scope could not pass through the airway due to blood clots. Meanwhile, his SBP dropped to 70-80 mmHg, which then recovered gradually after suction. The dose of Levophed was uptitrated to 23 ml/hr temporarily. The bronchoscopic study showed no active bleeder but excessive dynamic airway collapse. Critical condition was addressed to his daughter again, and she finally re-signed DNR permit (不電, 不壓, 不上二線以上升壓藥, 不洗腎, 不做心導管) on 10/04. Ophthalmologist was consulted on 10/05 for Candidiasis, showing no endophthalmitis. The MIC of the blood fungal culture showed the C. albicans was sensitive to micafungin and we continued micafungin. Blood fungal culture was repeated every 3 days. We gradually tapered the dose of Levophed and it was discontinued on 10/06. Aminofluid was changed to TPN for better nutrition support. Tarry stool aggravated on 10/06 (460 g), and component therapy was administered to keep Hb >8 and Plt >100k. Teicoplanin was discontinued on 10/07 after a 7-day course. Colistin was discontinued on 10/07 for clearance of MDRAB and decreasing urine output. Progressive abnormal liver function was noted, mixed type (d/t-bil 2.5/3.75, AST/ALT 574/265, ALP/GGT 389/994). Bedside echo showed no obvious biliary tree dilatation or stone. TPN was changed to cyclic TPN to prevent cholestasis. Keppra was discontinued. We had him try water since 10/08 and then administered trickle feeding 500 ml/day with pump to avoid mucosal atrophy.

[Nutrition] 10/06 alb 2.8 (supplement 10/07-09, 10-12)

[Important patient's and family's decisions]
兩個女兒一個兒子，大女兒在美國，二兒子在大陸
媳婦也會來照顧，family有line群組會交班
06/25 口頭 DNR不電不壓
06/28 Family decieded not to receive surgery. If clinical condition deteriorated, wish palliative care
07/01 Family agree not to arrange TAE if massive GI bleeding
07/03 如之後有大出血，升壓劑用到家屬來。同意抽胸水。希望能讓病人講話
08/03 re-confirm DNR status
10/03 consider no H/D and only one kinds of inotropics
10/04 DNR re-signed by daughter (不電, 不壓, 不上二線以上升壓藥, 不洗腎, 不做心導管)

Plan 
1. keep meropenem + micafungin 
  -> repeat F/C every 3 days (next time 10/09)
  -> goal: ward transfer next week
2. continue Rt pigtail drainage
3. keep Pantoloc 80mg cIF for history of GI bleeding
  -> consider somatostatin if massive bleeding
     or lower the dose if stable
  -> component threapy if indicated, keep Plt>100k if bleeding
  -> TPN for nutrition support, f/u electrolytes closely
4. taper steroid gradually to physiological dose.
   Now Solu-cortef 50mg q12h (10/07-)
5. informed family about poor outcome again
  -> re-signed DNR by his daughter (不電, 不壓, 不上二線以上升壓藥, 不洗腎, 不做心導管)
6. DC diuretics to prevent prerenal azotemia
   cotinue alb supplemnt (10/7-9, 10/10-12)
   closely f/u renal function, set dry weight 64 kg
7. try water, may try trickle feeding 500ml/day with pump to avoid mucosal atrophy later if tolerated
8. obtain hepatitis profile again for abnormal liver function
   change to cyclic TPN to avoid cholestasis
   beware drug-related hepatotoxicity, DC Keppra
