Brief Summary of this week    
After transferral, we kept TPN, transamine and PPI. However, intermittent tarry-bloody stool with hypotension was noted. Somatostatin pump infusion with pRBC transfusion was administered. Also, he had dyspnea and desaturation on 10/15. CXR revealed increased left side pleural effusion and consolidation. Sputum culture yielded MDRAB. After discussin with the ID specialist, Tigecycline and colistin was given. Left side pigtail was inserted for draining his pleural effusion. Also, we kept his I/O negative. On the CXR of 10/21, his pleural effusion improved significantly. However, his BUN level increased to 113, suspected GI bleeding or pre-renal azotemia related. According to cystatin C test, his eGFR is 16. Therefore, dopamine was started.
