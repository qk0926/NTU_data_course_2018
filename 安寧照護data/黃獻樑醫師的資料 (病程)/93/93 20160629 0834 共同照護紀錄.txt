1. Severe anemia, suspected GI bleeding, cause to be determined
2. Suspected ventilator associated pneumonia
3. Moderate aortic stenosis, complicated with acute lung edema and respiratory failure status post endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support (2014/03/13-2014/03/19), status post tracheostomy (2014/04/11)
4. Adrenal insufficiency under Cortisone 
5. Coronary artery disease, left main and 2-vessels disease

Massive lower GI bleeding with progound shock 
VT suspected severe metabolic acidosis related
CT: suspected colon cancer=>tumor bleeding?
[Plan]
1. Empirica upgrade Tazocin to Mepem
   (S/C PsA, Tazocin MIC 8) and keep Targocid for S/C MRSA
2. Solucortef 200mg/day for suspect relative adrenal insufficiency => Shift to oral Cortisone 2#/1# on 6/27
3. Ventilator support, monitor respiratory pattern
4. Keep inotropic agent for shock, followup labs Hb
5. Monitor hemogram and stool pattern, Massive GI bleeding noticed.

<Nurse>
GCS:E4M3VT，NPO中，PPN使用；持續監測觀察腸胃道出血的情形。

<Respiratory therapist>
 Keep ventilator full support, difficult weaning due to heart
 failure and pneumonia and massive GI bleeding and poor muscle
 power endurance.
