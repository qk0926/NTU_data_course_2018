Brief Summary of this week    
[Please refer to "treatment course" for history before 6/30]
After discussion, family signed DNR and favored not to receive emergent angiography if massive GI bleeding recurred. The hemodynamics was gradually improved with levophed tapered off and lower pitressin dose. 

Problem Assessment Plan   
          
PAP 1 
Assessment 
No gross bloody stool
Mildly decrease Hb level
Prominent scrotal edema and hernia component;
Keep tapering inotropic agnets;
S/C: Elizabethkingia meningosepticum 1+ 
          Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 1+
but currently no signs of aggravation of infection
=> keep current antibiotics
<Antibiotics>
Mepem    6/28- D5, for S/C PsA and GIBleeding suspected IAI
Targocid 6/27- D6, for S/C MRSA
Tazocin  6/23- D10, empirically for pneumonia

<Respiration>
PCV mode
IP=16, PEEP=10, FiO2=35%
-> TV=239, RR:16, MV:5.12, SpO2=100%

<Physical examination>
Consciousness: drowsiness, E4VtM5
HEENT: grossly general edema, improved
Chest: diffuse bilateral crackles 
Heart: regularly heart beats, RUSB III/VI murmur
Abdomen: hard and distended, right inguinal herina without local tenderness but not reducible
Extremities: diffusely pitting edema, less

<Inotropic agent>
Pitressin 4->2ml/hr

<Nutrition>
NPO with PPN use

<Culture report>
6/23 B/C:neg 
6/24 S/C:MRSA
6/25 B/C:neg X 3
     S/C PsA(WT)
     S/S: GNB3+(intracellular),GPB1+
6/29 S/C: Elizabethkingia meningosepticum 1+ 
          Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 1+   

<Important study findings>
6/25 ACTH/Cortisol: 35.3/42.5, FT4/TSH:0.822/0.395
6/28 CT: r/o colon cancer, proximal T-colon. Advise correlate with colonoscopy. Enlarged prostate. 
Right inguinal hernia. Bilateral lower lung consolidation and pleural effusion.

<Imporant consultation>
6/27 GI: for CFS, scheduled on 6/28 PM oncall
6/28 Radiologist: no obvious active bleeding, not suitable for TAE (TAE done with high risk of ischemic bowel), intussusception cannot be treated, suggest OP
6/28 GS(VS梁): OP could be arranged if the family would known risk and try
6/30 Hospice

<Important patient's and family's decisions>
6/25 口頭 DNR不電不壓
6/28 Family decieded not to receive surgery. If clinical condition deteriorated, wish palliative care
6/29 Family refuse surgery, consider no intervention if recurrent massive GI bleeding, also no hemodialysis if poor condition
7/1  Family agree not to arrange TAE if massive GI bleeding
Plan 
1. Mepem for PsA pneumonia and possible IAI
   (S/C PsA, Tazocin MIC 8)
   Targocid for S/C MRSA
2. Solucortef 150mg/day for suspect relative adrenal insufficiency 
3. Ventilator support, monitor respiratory pattern
-> Keep higher PEEP for lung edema
4. Keep inotropic agent for shock, monitor hemodynamic, urine output, and renal function
5. IV PPI use, hold plavix since 6/25
-> monitor hemogram, beware of recurrent massive GI bleeding
6. Consult hospice for palliative care.
7. Informed poor condition and grave prognosis
-> Suspect colon cancer, Poor heart-lung function, Sepsis, shock
-> family confirmed DNR, will discuss about whether no aggresive management if recurrent massive GI bleeding
8. Furosemide 20mg Q8H for fluid overload(both pulmonary and peripheral edema, increased BW)
