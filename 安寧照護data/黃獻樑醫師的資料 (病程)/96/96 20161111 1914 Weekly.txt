Brief Summary of this week    
During the past week, the patient has inproved fluid overload under diuretics usage. Follow-up for the elevated cardiac enzymes is not suggested due to low probability of ACS. The patient's conscious remained stationary without much imprvements. Grave prognosis is informed. Recurrent fever is noted under Unasyn, and central fever is suspected.

Plan 
DNR+ (°£endo)

1. Keep Unasyn with renal dose adjustment
   Antipyretics usage since central fever is more likely
2. Control BP, keep BP <160 mmHg
   decrease perdipine is possible
3. Keep I/O balance to negative due to fluid overload
4. close follow up neurological sign
5. Inform grave prognosis
