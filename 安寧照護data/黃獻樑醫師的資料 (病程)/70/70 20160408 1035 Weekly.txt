[Brief History]
  She was bedridden as baseline. She was under regular hemodialysis. She had frequent diarrhea on 3/10. On 3/11, hypotension and fever. Pneumonia complicated with septic shock was the tentative diagnosis. Tienam and Levophed were given. Seizure generalized clonic movements was noted as well. She was transferred to our hospital on 3/12 under family's request.

[Treatment Course]
  After admission, diflucan, mepem and targocid were prescribed for infection control. CVVH was started for electrolyte imbalance. Levophed and dopamine were given for low blood pressure and dopamine was tapered off on 3/13. On 3/14, under relative stable BP and electrolytes, we shifted CVVH to SLED. However after SLED in 3/14 night, intermittent short-run VT with unstable blood pressure was noted in 3/15 morning. Cordarone infusion was given and rhythm was corrected. Prolonged QTc was so we contacted CV physician on 3/16, who suggested to correct electrolytes and avoid medication including Difucan, Cordaron and Dopamine. 
  She had poor digestion since 3/18 so we added laxatives and prokinetics agents and adjusted diet under dietition's suggestion. However Primperan was hold due to QTc prolong. Ascites was found with bedside echo, but paracentesis was not favored due to coagulopathy. 
  Lab data showed elevated lactic acid after SLED suspect related to hypoperfusion. Therefore, we started CVVH on 3/23 again. Meanwhile, fever was noted again on 3/23. We consulted ID specialist, who suggested to send acid fast stain. However, fever was noted again with progressive leukocytosis and hypotension  since 3/26, so we contacted ID physician again. He suggested to add empirical Cravit and Eraxis, and stopeed We contacted with ID VS again on 3/28. She suggested us to stop targocid due to lack evidence of GPC infection. Prolonged QTc happened again on 3/28 so we hold Cravit. Femoral CVC was removed on 3/30. Abdominal echo performed on 3/29 showed distended bowel with minimal ascites. We followed up abdominal CT with contrast on 3/30 which showed ileus and minimal ascites and contrast medium in GI tract. We started TPN and consulted GI specialist who suggested shock-related poor digestion.
    In suspect of CRBSI, we change cervical CVC and tip culture revelaed GPC. Due to poor bowel function, we further checked C.diff toxin, which was positive. So metronidazole was used since 4/6. For follow-up seizure acitivity, we arranged EEG on 4/7 showing diffuse slow waves without significant epileptiform discharge, so we downgrade antiepileptic agents. Due to poor weaning capibitilty, we discuss with family and consulted hospice team for discussing for withdraw. Family meeting was held on 4/8, and they finally decided to withdraw all aggresive interventions including inotropics, antibiotics, and hemodialysis, and elective extubation was also agreed.
