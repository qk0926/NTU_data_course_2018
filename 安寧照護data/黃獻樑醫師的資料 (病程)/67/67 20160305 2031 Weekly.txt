Brief Summary of this week    
After transferred to 4B1, CVC was replaced to the left neck. PiCCO showed mixed shock. Levophed and dopamine were given. Profound shock with metabolic acidosis occurred in the evening on 3/3, and Bosmin was prescribed. CVVH was initiated on 3/4 for metabolic acidosis. Solucortef was given for adrenal insufficiency. G-CSF was also given for the neutropenia. The body weight increased 3 kg on 3/5, and ultrafiltration was thus initiated.

[Important study]
11/17 PD fluid:MDRAB; Blood culture: MDRAB, enterococcus
      S/C: MDRAB
1/25 Tenckoff tip/C: MDRAB
1/26 S/C: MDRAB 1+ Proteus mirabilis 1+
2/23 left psoas muslce abscess: 
     AFS:(-); bacterial:(-); fungus:( )
2/25 omentum abscess:
     AFS:( ), bacterial:(-), fungus:( )
01/19 LVEF: 28.9%, LVEDD/ESD: 53/45mm, akin at antero+sept wall
2/19  CT(A+P): Left psoas abscess. Suspected intraabdominal abscess(smaller than that on 1/31)
2/23  left psoas hematoma, status post CT-guided aspiration
2/25  Fluid collection in anterior abdominal omentum, S/P catheter drainage.

[Important consultation]
1/29 ID Wang: The MDRAB is sensitive to carbapenem and 
     colistin. May keep meropenem + colistin. 
     No need for Tigecycline. 
2/01 GS Dr. 李志元: low benefit of ileus OP
2/23 Radiologist: <1ml old blood-like fluid was aspirated from left psoas muscle, r/o hematoma; sent for culture; if aspiration still needed, may consult Dr.梁 for superficial lower abdomen abscess drainage
3/3 ID Dr盤：Consider shifting Mepem to Tigecycline for suspecting myelosuppression from prolonged use of beta-lactam and adding Ciprofloxacin for covering pseudomonas, which was in risk of resistance to Colistin since prolonged course of Colistin treatment.

Plan 
1. For profound shock, keep strong antibiotics according to ID man suggestion(Colistin D53+Tygacil D3+Ciproxin D3)
- Family agreed on cash G-CSF(FN with profound shock), f/u CBC closely
- SoluCortef 200mg/day infusion for adrenal insufficiency
- Keep CVVH for ongoing acidosis and for fluid removal(volume contraction according to PiCCO result if BP more stable)
(DW 55.5~56kg?), now 57.3kg; start UF with I/O balance goal(UF~100ml) if more stable BP
- Levophed+Dopamine+Bosmin support, consider Dopamine first
- Check PiCCO when off CVVH
- May arrange C+A+P CT in morning when off CVVH
- DNR 不電不壓
2. Keep Cordarone 200mg BID for frequent VPCs, DC Mexitil for now decompensated heart failure
3. Plavix for CAD. Pletaal for PAOD.
