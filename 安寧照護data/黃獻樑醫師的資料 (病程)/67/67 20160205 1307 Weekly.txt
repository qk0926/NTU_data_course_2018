<3C2 treatment course>
  After transferring to MICU, BiPAP was perofmred for pneumonia and heart failure with impenidng respiratory failure. Colistin and Meropenem was prescribed for covering MDRAB due to previous B/C hx b(2015/11). SLED was performed during hemodialysis due to shock status and then levophed was added. We had contacted with VS李志元, then hold the operation of Tenckhoff catheter removal due to poor general condition. Due to poor prognosis, we also consulted hospice team for mental support.
  We contacted with CV VS李任光, then low dose dopamine for heart failure support was suggested. The fever curve got improved gradually and then we tried daily interruption BiPAP with mask, he could tolerate with the condition well. For further adjusted the dose of dopamine and levophed, PiCCO was placed on 1/22, then we tried tapered levophed gradually. Due to relative stable condition, we contacted with VS李志元, the operation for Tenckhoff catheter removal will be done on 1/25
  On 1/25, Tenckhoff catheter was removed smoothly,ETT+MV was arranged after the operation, then we tried tapered ventilator setting gradually and tried turned off the levophed, but intermittent BP dropped noted. The fever got subsided, but still poor digestion was noted, several stool-like content drained from the NG tube. So we kept NPO, and much prulent sputum noted on 1/30, with dyspnea, so we switched PSV to PCV on 1/30, and then switched back to PSV due to improved dyspnea.

We contacted with GS VS李志元 for suspected intra-abdominal abscess formation noted by 2016/01/31 CT study. He suggested to keep current treatment. Ventilator was gradually tapered down, and he tolerated it well. Extubation was performed on 2016/02/02. He tolerated O2 mask support initially, but desaturation developed at night, so BiPAP use was applied. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, so we kept hemodialysis for fluid overload. Follow-up chest radiography showed improved lung edema. Dopamine was kept for hemodynamic support, to keep SBP>90.

<Plan>
1. Keep Meropenem and colistin for MDRAB peritonitis. 
   Anidulafungin for high risk of fungemia, keep for 7 days
2. NPO for poor digestion, D5OW use
3. Switch to oral PPIs
4. SLED QW1,3,5 DW:55.5kg. Albumin supplement during SLED
5. Cordarone and mexiletine for frequent VPCs
   Plavix for CAD. Pletaal for POAD
6. Keep BiPAP support and monitor respiratory pattern, informed the risk of re-intubation; taper BiPAP use gradually as tolerates
7. Dopamine and hemodynamic support, keep SBP>90, may add on low dose Levophed
