He experienced progressive dyspnea with acute respiratory failure and admitted to MICU for further management

CxR: improving over left pneumonia
easily hypotension when HD

Suggest:
-> Under BiPAP with O2 demand improved, gradual taper off BiPAP time
-> Poor GI feeding now NPO, start TPN
-> hemodynamics more stable, gradual taper down intrope dosage
-> under broadspectrum antibiotic for IAI, CT favored focal ileus and suspect distal ileum lesion/or local abscess
-> under iv colistin+ meropenem for AB IAI
-> RRT with reset dry weight
-> contact ward CR
-> inform family current status and further treatemtn plan
