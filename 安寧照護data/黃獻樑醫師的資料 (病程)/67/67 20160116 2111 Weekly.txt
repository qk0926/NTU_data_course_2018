Brief Summary of this week    
After transferring to MICU, BiPAP was perofmred for pneumonia and heart failure with impenidng respiratory failure. Colistin and Meropenem was prescribed for covering MDRAB due to previous B/C hx b(2015/11). SLED was performed during hemodialysis due to shock status and then levophed was added. We had contacted with VS李志元, then hold the operation of Tenckhoff catheter removal due to poor general condition. Due to poor prognosis, we also consulted hospice team for mental support.
