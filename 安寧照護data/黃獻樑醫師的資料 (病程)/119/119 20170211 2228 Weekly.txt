Brief Summary of this week    
We kept chest tubes drainage after the VATs decortication. The colour of the pleural fluid was yellowish-reddish, the amount was about 100ml daily. The pus culture sent on 1/31 grew MDRAB and MRSA again. Tienam was added, combing with colistin and Vancomycin for empyema treatment. There were two chest tubes for pus drainage, which were inserted during VATS decortication. The posterior one was removed since it was out of function.  

The patient had breakthrough fever under Colistin, Tienam and Vancomycin. The right pleural fluid was sent for culture again, which still yielded MRSA and MDRAB. Vancomycin was changed to Zyvox for poor treatment response. In addition, the sputum culture grew Ralstonia mannitolilytica, so Cravit was added. The patient had progressive lactic acidosis, and infection related was considered. Due to instable vital signs and fluid retention, continuous renal replacement therapy was used during 2017/2/5-2/8. The metabolic disturbance was corrected, and the body weight returned to 72 kilograms after fluid elimination. Intermittent hemodialysis was resumed since 2017/2/10. 

The patient's blood pressure was fluctuating during hemodialysis. The adrenal function was checked, which showed ACTH 20.5, cortisol 9.76 at 03:30am. Therefore, solu-cortef 50mg twice daily was prescribed relative adrenal insufficiency. The inotropics was tappered off successfully under the steroid.

[Decisions]
**家屬簽立DNR,但仍希望積極處理

Plan 
1. For MDRAB + MRSA Empyema
 - Keep Colistin + Tienam + Zyvox for empyema
 - Keep Cravit for the Ralstonia mannitolytica yielded from sputum
 - Keep chest tube drainage with 2-bottle system
 - Consider fibrinolysis if poor drainage effect
 - if still fever, add antifungal agents
2. for Afib
 - keep Rytmonorm and Cordarone, keep electrolyte balanced
3. For ESRD
 - keep SLED QW135, Albumin supplement, set dry weight 72kg
4. Add solu-cortef 50mg Q12H for relative adrenal insufficiency
5. Consider NJ placement if still poor digestion
6. EPO supplement, keep Hb~10

PAP2

Assessment 
[Consultation]
01/12 Rheumatologist: suggested keep infection under control, check anti-CCP, electrophoresis, Plaquenil 1# QD
01/18 Neurologist: suggested correct all metabolic factor, perform perfusion CT if possible
01/23 Hospice combine care: for introduction and withdrawl
01/25 Chest surgeon Dr.陳克誠: VATS decortication ,pneumothorax repair and tracheostomy were indicated and would arrange operation after INR was corrected below 1.5
02/05 ID: Tigecycline replacing Vancomycin may be considered if refractory shock (MDRAB + MRSA empyema), but contraindicated if bacteremia; replace Vancomycin with Zyvox also suitable
