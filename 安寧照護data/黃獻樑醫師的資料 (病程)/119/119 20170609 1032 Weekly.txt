Brief Summary of this week    
There was no pus noted from right chest open window wound, so we decreased the frequency of wet dressing to 2 times a day on 6/6. We downgraded fentanyl patch to ultracet on 6/7. The patient was more alert with less painful facial expression under ultracet. We decreased HD frequency to 2 times a week. We consulted chest surgeon on 6/8 for right chest wall open wound closure. The family (patient's daughter) confirmed that they didn't want antibiotics if infection again.  Right chest wall wound closure would be arranged to achieve more life quality. We will change double lumen catheter after surgery have been scheduled. 


Assessment 
1.Poor consciousness (E2-E3, M4VT). Multiple session of infection during five months admission. Renal failure developed during admission and now on regular hemodialysis. 

2.Due to abovementioned conditions, the family strongly against prolonged antibiotics, blood tests, inotropics. We will keep hospice care.

3. However, infection from empyema status post thoracotomy wound was resolved. No pus discharge from thoracotomy wound under wet dressing Q12H.
