Brief Summary of this week    
After transferal, we kept Colistin and Tygecycline for MRSA and MDRAB empyema treatment. Recheck Procalcitonin was 0.42 (3/13). Increased size of pneumothorax was noted, hence low pressure suction, with -10cm H2O, right chest tube was added. Due to persistant airleak, family meeting with chest surgeon for further intervention was arranged on 3/16, and family agreeded thoracotomy.

  On the other hand, due to improment of oliguria and hyperkalemia, hemodialysis was held since 3/13. Persistant hypokalemia and diarrhea were also noted. Stool examinations were all negative (Stool fat: negative, Stool OB +/-, Stool WBC 0-2, Clostridium toxin: negative). Aldactone, potassium solution were given for correction of hypokalemia. Metronidazole empirical use were also started. 


PAP1

Assessment 
1.The empyema is difficult to be controlled. Keep antibiotics and postural drainage. Thoracotomy will be arranged for further wound healing and infection control.

2.Set index of infection control, ex: procalcitonin, CT, or drainage color.
3/13 Procalcitonin 0.42

Plan 
1. For MDRAB + MRSA Empyema
-Monitor drain amount and color
-Await CMV viral load level.
-Keep Colistin + Tigecycline for MDRAB 
-Keep Tygecycline for MRSA.
-Thoracotomy on 3/20.

PAP2

Assessment 
1.Persistant hypokalemia, suspect diarrhea associated. Possibly mixed renal loss.
TTKG=5.

2.Hypokalemia currently under aldactone 1# tid + Potassium solution 270ml per day.

3.No stool WBC, Hb , or fatty acid. Increase smecta dose.

Plan 
1.For hypokalemia and diarrhea
-Monitor diarrhea amount
-target 2100cal/day (30/kg)
-Follow up potassium level Q12H.
