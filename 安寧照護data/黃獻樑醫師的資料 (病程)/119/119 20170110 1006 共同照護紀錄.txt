4. Acute kidney injury, AKIN stage III, favor sepsis related

Plan:
1. for pneumonia, sepsis
 - discontinue Meropenam and Fluconazole, and start Levofloxacin
 - Keep steroid for ARDS and/or organizing pneumonia(keep solu-medrol 20mg Q8H)(taper if oxygenation improve)
2. for Afib with PPM 
 - hold apixaban due to current sinus rhythm 
 - Sinus rhythm, DC cordarone, keep rytnomorm
3. for AKI
  - Watch out worsening renal function: prerenal pattern, sepsis, hypotension, CVP 6->4
    => family refuse tracheostomy, accept RRT 
 - keep albumin supplement
 - adjust enteral feeding as tolerated
 - hydration with D5W for hypernatremia
4.For conscious prolonged disturbances
 - consider lumbar puncture, family hesitated
 - Consider self paid Flumazenil (自費同意書已給，家屬怕影響 renal function考慮中)
