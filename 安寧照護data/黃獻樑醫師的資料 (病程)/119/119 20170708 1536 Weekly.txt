He received right empyema VATS decortication on 2017/7/3 and was transferred to 4B1 for post-operative care. He was transferred back to general ward on 7/4. Hemodialysis was hold due to low blood pressure noted (SBP about 80-90 mmHg). Occasional hypotension due to relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected so we increased Cortisone to 1 tab BID. Fair blood pressure was noted on 7/5. Family agreed with blood transfusion during hemodialysis. He receive hemodialysis smoothly with pRBC 2 U transfusion. Therefore, we tappered down his Cortisone gradually. We consulted plastic surgeon for sacral and right calf pressrue sore evaluation. Bed side debridement was performed and we change wound dressing to wet dressing under the surgeon's recommendation.
