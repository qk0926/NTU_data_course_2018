Brief Summary of this week    
On 3/2, C+A+P CECT was performed for persistent ileus, which revealed: diffuse dilatation of small bowel and colon, but no obstruction site. After discussion with GI fellow, hypoperfusion(previous shock status) related ileus was impressed, suggested keep adequate blood pressure and observation. Primperan dosage was then added up. Rectal tube was also inserted. Then, much stool(about 6000gm) passage was noted on 3/3, and his abdominal fullness improved.
Empyema and pneumothorax -> CS Dr.陳 will evaluate his condition for possible surgical intervention.

Plan 
1. For MDRAB + MRSA + C. glabrata Empyema
 - Keep Tigecycline for both MDRAB and MRSA
 - chest tubes drainage for air and pus
 - wound care
 - consider pleurodesis if infection improved
 - consider open thoracotomy if empyema persisted
2. For ESRD
 - keep HD QW135, Albumin supplement, set dry weight 73kg
 - cash EPO

Assessment 
[Consultation]
01/12 Rheumatologist: suggested keep infection under control, check anti-CCP, electrophoresis, Plaquenil 1# QD
01/18 Neurologist: suggested correct all metabolic factor, perform perfusion CT if possible
01/23 Hospice combine care: for introduction and withdrawl
01/25 Chest surgeon Dr.陳克誠: VATS decortication ,pneumothorax repair and tracheostomy were indicated and would arrange operation after INR was corrected below 1.5
02/05 ID: Tigecycline replacing Vancomycin may be considered if refractory shock (MDRAB + MRSA empyema), but contraindicated if bacteremia; replace Vancomycin with Zyvox also suitable
02/13 Radiologist: NJ will be performed on 2/14 on call
02/14 ID: ID: C. glabrata perhaps just colonized on the chest tube. If we want to confirm that it was a true pathogen, thoracocentesis was needed. Or we could add Echinocandin in the next fever episode
02/16 ID: Eraxis is indicated due to newly developed septic shock
02/21 Consult CS Dr. 陳克誠:
He will explain to the family and arrange surgery again
02/22 CS Dr. 陳克誠: surgery will be arranged on 2/25, on call
