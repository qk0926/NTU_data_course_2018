[Consultation]
[Family decision]
01/02 agreed albumin infusion for correction of hypoalbuminemia and hypotension
01/04 Verbally expressed DNR (¤£À£¤£¹q), considering for HD
01/06 Signed permits for hemodialysis.
      Hesitated with tracheostomy, cannot decide on DNR
      (May requested family meeting again)

Plan 
1. for pneumonia, sepsis
 - Keep Meroepnem and Fluconazole
 - Repeated chest CT revealed bialteral fibrosis with calcification refractory to antibiotic treatment, inform poor prognosis.
 - administered steroid for ARDS and/or organizing pneumonia(keep solu-medrol 20mg Q8H)
 - Watch out worsening renal function: prerenal pattern, sepsis, hypotension, CVP 6
  => inform family possibility of RRT 
 - keep albumin supplement
 - adjust enteral feeding as tolerated
2. for Afib with PPM 
 - hold apixaban due to current sinus rhythm 
 - Sinus rhythm, DC cordarone, keep rytnomorm
3. For conscious prolonged disturbances
 - consider lumbar puncture
