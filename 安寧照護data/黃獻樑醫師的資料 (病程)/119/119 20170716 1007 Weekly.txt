We consulted plastic surgeon on 2017/7/7 for evaluation of pressure sore and started wet-dressing due to poor wound-bed condition. His right calf pressure sore improved after applying wet-dressing. However, more slough and odour over sacral pressure sore was noted. Under plastic specialist suggestion, Hydrogel with wet dressing was applied on 7/14. Bed-side wound debridement was recommended but patient's family refused.

We discussed with the family about permcath implantation for long-term dialysis use on 2017/7/10. Patient's family refused to receive permcath implantation.

After discussing with the nephrologist, we will check pre-HD blood tests on 7/18 (W2) and discuss with the nephrologist about the adjusment of HD.
