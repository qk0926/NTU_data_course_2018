Pus discharge from the old chest tube wound
Soft tissue infection was considered in stead of residual empyema

CxR: no effusion accumulation over right side, stable
persistent right pneumothorax

septic shock under Levophed cIF, improving

2.Monitor chest tube function
3.Chest CT with/without contrast for infection site
