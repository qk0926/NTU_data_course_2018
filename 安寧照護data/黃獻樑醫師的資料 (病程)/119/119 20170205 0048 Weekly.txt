Brief Summary of this week    
During this week, we kept chest tube drainage. The pleural fluid still was yellowish-reddish. The pus culture sent on 1/31 grew MDRAB and MRSA again. Tienam was added, combing with colistin and Vancomycine for empyema treatment. 

Midodrine 4tab Q6H was added in order to tapper off levophed. However, the patient's blood pressure still fluctuating under low dose levophed. He had frequent ventricular premature contraction, but cordarone was discontinued because of QTc prolongation.

[Decisions]
**家屬簽立DNR,但仍希望積極處理

Plan 
1. For MDRAB bacteremia, MRSA Empyema
 - Keep Colistin(IV+IH) for MDRAB infection
 - Add Tienam on 2/3 for combine treatment
 - keep Vancomycin for MRSA empyema
 - Remove the posterior chest tube on Monday
2. for Afib with PPM 
 - hold apixaban, keep rytnomorm
 - hold Cordarone due to QT prolongation
3. keep HD QW1,3,5
  - Set DW 70kg, Ca 3, K 3, Na 140
  - administer albumin for low BP during HD
  - Add midodrine 4tab Q6H in order to stop levophed
  - check adrenal function next Monday to survey relative adrenal insufficiency
