Brief Summary of this week    
Wet dressing Q8H was kept for right thoracotomy wound, and Tigecycline+Colistin were shifted to Ceftriaxone according to wound culture: Serratia marscenes. However, right hemothorax with hypovolemic shock developed at night of 4/4 night, there was no prominent bleeding point noted, and bleeding improved after bosmin compression and component therapy. In addition, AfRVR and pacemaker related Wide QRS tachycardia developed. Hemodynamics were stabilized under norepinephrine support and hydration, and empirical Meropenem+Teicoplanin were adminsitered. Due to suspicion of uremic bleeding, SLED was reinitiated on 4/5. Teicoplanin was discontinued on 4/7 for no evidence of GPC, however, worsening right thoracotomy wound condition was noted, and TMP/SMX was added for coverage of Burkholderia after discussion with ID specialist.
  SLED was held after 4/8 due to improved azotemia and fair urine output. For follow-up S/C and wound culture yielded multiple sets of MDRAB, IV and IH colistin were administered and meropenem was shifted to Tigecycline. SLED was resumed on 4/15 for azotemia reaccumulated.

[Consultation]
4/5 Dr.朝F蕹: The suspected VT episode was actually pacing rhythm.
  Possible mechanism:
    AfRVR -> amiodarone loading 
    => conversion to sinus rhythm and inhibition of AV conduction
    => A sensing V pacing with wide QRS tachycardia;
    Suggest Off xylocaine, could resume Amiodarone PO.
4/8 ID Dr.LZj:
    Pursue repeated wound culture result
    Add TMP/SMX for coverage of Burkholderia cenocepacia and good wound penetration.
4/10 ID Dr.法和{:
    Due to improvement of wound condition after TMP/SMX, keep current antibiotics first.
    If condition deteriorated, consider add on colistin, keep meropenem+TMP/SMX
4/10 CS Dr.朝J港:
  Wet dressing Q8H->Q12H.
  The reconstruction of right thoracotomy wound only could be performed after condition stabilized (very clean wound, improved infection sign, no recent deterioration events)
4/13 ID Dr.法和{:
  Shift Meropenem-> Tigecycline for MDRAB and coverage of Serratia
  Add IH colistin
  No evidence for Colistin local use

Plan 
1.For empyema
 - Keep wet dressing Q8H (check wound culture frequently)
   (ID specialist: Local colistin use was not suggested)
 - Keep colistin IH+IV for multiple MDRAB culture from sputum
   and right thoracotomy wound
 - Keep TMP/SMX for B. cenocepacia & good wound penetration
 - Switch Meropenem to Tigecycline (4/13-) for MDRAB
 - Weaning is not considered now.

2. For hypotension during SLED
 - Levophed support PRN. Pursue blood culture result.
 - Closely monitor patient's heart rhythm.
 - Give albumin supplement

3. For azotemia
 - Adjust DW. Keep lasix 1# Q12H.
 - Closely monitor renal function, start RRT since 4/5
   Consider resume SLED when BUN>=100(Resume SLED today)

4. Amiodarone 1# QD.
