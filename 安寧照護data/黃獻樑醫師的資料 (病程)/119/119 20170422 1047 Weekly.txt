Brief Summary of this week    
Wet dressing Q8H was kept for right thoracotomy wound, and Tigecycline+Colistin were shifted to Ceftriaxone according to wound culture: Serratia marscenes. However, right hemothorax with hypovolemic shock developed at night of 4/4 night, there was no prominent bleeding point noted, and bleeding improved after bosmin compression and component therapy. In addition, AfRVR and pacemaker related Wide QRS tachycardia developed. Hemodynamics were stabilized under norepinephrine support and hydration, and empirical Meropenem+Teicoplanin were adminsitered. Due to suspicion of uremic bleeding, SLED was reinitiated on 4/5. Teicoplanin was discontinued on 4/7 for no evidence of GPC, however, worsening right thoracotomy wound condition was noted, and TMP/SMX was added for coverage of Burkholderia after discussion with ID specialist.
  SLED was held after 4/8 due to improved azotemia and fair urine output. For follow-up S/C and wound culture yielded multiple sets of MDRAB, IV and IH colistin were administered and meropenem was shifted to Tigecycline. SLED was resumed on 4/15 for azotemia reaccumulated.
  B/C yielded Serratia marscenes on 4/11 and 4/17, and Cefepime was administered. Colistin was discontinued for emergence of colistin resistance on MDRAB. With better respiratory pattern, ventilator setting was adjusted to PSV with PS:10cmH2O.

[Consultation]
4/5 Dr.陳政瑋: The suspected VT episode was actually pacing rhythm.
  Possible mechanism:
    AfRVR -> amiodarone loading 
    => conversion to sinus rhythm and inhibition of AV conduction
    => A sensing V pacing with wide QRS tachycardia;
    Suggest Off xylocaine, could resume Amiodarone PO.
4/8 ID Dr.林武甫:
    Pursue repeated wound culture result
    Add TMP/SMX for coverage of Burkholderia cenocepacia and good wound penetration.
4/10 ID Dr.楊睿璿:
    Due to improvement of wound condition after TMP/SMX, keep current antibiotics first.
    If condition deteriorated, consider add on colistin, keep meropenem+TMP/SMX
4/10 CS Dr.陳克誠:
  Wet dressing Q8H->Q12H.
  The reconstruction of right thoracotomy wound only could be performed after condition stabilized (very clean wound, improved infection sign, no recent deterioration events)
4/13 ID Dr.楊睿璿:
  Shift Meropenem-> Tigecycline for MDRAB and coverage of Serratia
  Add IH colistin
  No evidence for Colistin local use
4/18 CS Dr.陳克誠:
  Keep wound dressing. May consider wound closure if wound condition very clear under wet dressing QD

Plan 
1.For empyema
 - Resume Wet dressing Q8H(4/21~) due to deterioration of wound condition.
   (ID specialist: Local colistin use was not suggested)
 - DC colistin IH+IV according to MIC result
 - Keep TMP/SMX for B. cenocepacia & good wound penetration
 - Switch Meropenem to Tigecycline (4/13-) for MDRAB
 - Add Cefepime for B/C: Serratia marcescens, 
   F/U B/C from CVC+DLC+ peripheral on 4/22
 - Catheter exchange if persistent bacteremia
 - Weaning is not considered now.
 - Transfer to general ward after completion of RCC session if no ICU indication(will 通報無主床next W1)
2. For hypotension during SLED
 - Levophed support PRN. Pursue blood culture result.
 - Closely monitor patient's heart rhythm.

3. For azotemia
 - Adjust DW. Hold lasix due to low BP.
 - Closely monitor renal function, RRT during 4/5-4/7
   Resume SLED for BUN>=100 since 4/15
 - keep albumin supplement during SLED 

4. Hold Amiodarone due to abnormal liver function
   (better liver function tests)
