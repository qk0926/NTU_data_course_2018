[Consultation]
01/12 Rheumatologist: suggested keep infection under control, check anti-CCP, electrophoresis, Plaquenil 1# QD

[Family decision]
01/02 agreed albumin infusion for correction of hypoalbuminemia and hypotension
01/04 Verbally expressed DNR (不壓不電), considering for HD
01/06 Signed permits for hemodialysis.
      Hesitated with tracheostomy, cannot decide on DNR
      (May requested family meeting again)
01/07 明確未來不氣切
01/10 agreed with trying Flumazenil
01/11 agreed doing lumbar puncture
01/14 Signed DNR

Plan 
1. for pneumonia, and MDRAB bacteremia
 - Keep Brosym and colistin for MDRAB infection
 - tapper steroid for ARDS and/or organizing pneumonia
2. for Afib with PPM 
 - hold apixaban, cordarone, keep rytnomorm
3. for AKI
  - Watch out worsening renal function: prerenal pattern, sepsis, hypotension,
  - monitor urine output closely, and start RRT if u/o decreased
  - adjust enteral feeding as tolerated
4.For conscious prolonged disturbances
 - pursue lab data
 - since lumbar puncture revealed no active problem, consider brain MRI and EEG
5. For Autoimmune profile abnormalities
 - do as rheumatologist's advice
6. DNR signed, keep treatment for MDRAB, if still no response, consult palliative combine care team, and perhaps withdraw from treatment
