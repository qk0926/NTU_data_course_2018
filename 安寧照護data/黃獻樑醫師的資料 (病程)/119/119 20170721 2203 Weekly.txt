Pre-HD blood tests for evalution of HD was performed on 7/18. After discussing with the nephrologist, we concluded that patient was not feasible to tapper the frequency HD. Therefore, we kept patient receiving HD twice per week.

  We discussed with the patient's son and elder sister about the paitent's condition on 7/18. They expressed their willing of hospice care (including no antibiotics use, titrating frequency of HD, withdrawl of the ventilator). Therefore, family meeting was hold at PM 3:00 on 7/21. The participants included 出院準備小組、安寧共照團隊、VS吳政翰、臨床倫理代表 and 家屬(兒子、小女兒、大女兒、妻子). We exlpained the current condition of the patient and the terminal stage of the disease. The family expressed the willing of withdrawl ventilator or discontinuing hemodialysis. We discussed the issue from the aspect of laws and ethics. We had the consensus including
1. Hospice care (DNR 全拒，不抽血，不上抗生素)
2. May trasfer to other RCW /institution if bed is available and patient's condition remained stable
3. May withdrawl the mechanical ventilator support with protocol
4. May discontinue the hemodialysis

They will discuss about the issues and make their final decision.
