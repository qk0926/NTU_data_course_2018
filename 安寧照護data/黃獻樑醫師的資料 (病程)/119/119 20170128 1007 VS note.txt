right pneumonia and empyema, under antibiotics and chest tube drainage
VATS decortication, tracheostomy has been arranged. But hemodynamics are very unstable now. Marked tachyarrhythmia and short-run VT. VR around 140-160, under amiodarone infusion.
Persistent air leakage via chest tube. BP fistula is highly likely. related to necrotizing pneumonia?
respiratory distress, marked. RR=35. After ventilator being switched to pressure-trigger and zero PEEP, the rate is not decreased. Therefore, the respiratory rate is not resulted from air leakage.
monitor and treat cardiac rhythm/rate first
keep chest tube drainage
withhold operation today
