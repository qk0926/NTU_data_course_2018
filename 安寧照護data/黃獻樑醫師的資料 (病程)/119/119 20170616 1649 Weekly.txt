Brief Summary of this week    
Follow-up lab data showed hypokalemia 2.7. We kept KCl supplement from NG. The palliative team visited the patient and his family on 6/12, and we increased Ultracet to 1 tab Q6H due to painful facial expression during wet dressing observed by the patient's wife. 


Assessment 
1.Poor consciousness (E3-4, M3VT). Multiple session of infection during five months admission. Renal failure developed during admission and now on regular hemodialysis. 

2.Due to abovementioned conditions, the family strongly against prolonged antibiotics, blood tests, inotropics. We will keep hospice care.

3. However, infection from empyema status post thoracotomy wound was resolved. No pus discharge from thoracotomy wound under wet dressing Q12H.
