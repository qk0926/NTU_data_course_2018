Brief Summary of this week    
After admission, Fever subsided, we gave high dose diuretics and dopamine, she responce with good urine output. However high BUN was still noted until 7/26. However, left side weakness was noted on 7/27. CT brain was arranged to rule out stroke and showed negative findings. Uremic ecephealopathy was supsected. Bokey was added for ischemic stroke cannot totally rule out. SLED was arranged during 7/27-29. Still IDH during HD was noted on 7/27 and 7/28. Inotropics was shifted to dobutamine and levophed. One fever episode with BP dropped was noted on 08/01, therefore antibiotics were switched from Tazocin+Targocid to Mepem+Targocid, and Diflucan was added for possible fungus infection. Her sputum culture showed Ralstonia mannitolilytica, and we had ordered MIC testing, the result was pending. Her urine output amount was small, so we tried to switch Levophed+Dobutaime to Dopamine, and practically we discontinted Dobutamine and added Dopamine first, and tapered Levophed accroding to blood pressure. Cordarone was added for VPCs, and would be hold if hear rate less than 70bpm. Her ventilator setting was improving gradually.
