   She was now receiving CCRT (last chemo: 2015/9/17, RT: 2015/09/22). She was ADLs independent but weakness was reported recently. Her caregiver reported she had much sputum recently and choking noted sometimes. This time, she was just about to have her C/T. Collapse was noted before eating, and CPR was performed by EMT for 17  min for asystole, and was sent to NTUH ER for CPR for 7 min. ROSC was noted later. She was sent to ICU for therapeutic hypothermia and postresuscitation care.
Due to EEG showed isoelectric activity, Brain perfusion showed mild to moderate hypoperfusion. After family meeting was held, withdraw life support system was requested. 
  病人以前開雜貨店，記憶力非常好，這次OHCA前ECOG=2，大家每天會輪流回家探視母親。雖然不捨，但也不想讓病人再多受苦；團隊向家人解釋拔管流程(預立DNR不再重插, 使用鎮靜及止喘藥物, 拔管後survival難以預測等)，家人表示理解，但希望拔完管後可以轉安寧病房讓家人陪伴。家人會看日子決定何時撤管。
