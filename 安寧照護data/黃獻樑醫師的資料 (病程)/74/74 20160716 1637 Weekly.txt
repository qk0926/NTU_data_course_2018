Brief Summary of this week    
Her consciouness level further deteriorated to comatase status. Her families refused diagnostic lumbar puncture due to its invasivness and little influence on treatment plan. We ketp supportive care for her and informed her families about grave prognosis. 

High fever up to 39.8 Celsius degree developed on 7/9 and a new infection was impressed. Septic work-up was done and her wound culture and sputum culture yielded MDRAB. Thus we administered colistin for her. Her fever subsided under this regimen. Her heart rate and consciousness became stable within normal range. 

However, another new episode of infection developed on 7/15. We empirically used Targocid to better cover MRSA. She still had fever with intropic agent use.

Assessment 
[New episode of fever]
Breakthrough fever to 38.1 degree this night under colistin and diflucan
then desaturation with low tidal volume
SBP: 90~100 under levophed 3ml/hr
-> still poor consciousness
-> bilateral crackles breathing sound, symmetric
-> low tidal volume improving after sputum suction and shift PCV
-> repeat septic work up was done 
-> emperical Add Targocid for previous wound culture showed MRSA(poor wound healing)

Plan 
1. Keep current management and puruse the result of septic 
   work-up.
2. Keep wet-dressing to the spine OP wound, bosmin gause 
   packing due to active oozings. Component therapy as 
   needed.
3. Complete work-up of unexplained metabolic acidosis(AG + Non-AB)
-> Complete osmolal gap and urine anion gap on 7/15
-> Discuss with nephrologist for possible D-lactate acidosis
 **Unexplained metabolic acidosis with poor consciousness, poor digestion, aggravation after DC vancomycin. But no definite documented risk, such as short bowel syndrome or infusion of  propylene glycol-containing medications. There is also presence of other alternative diagnosis, such as progression of brain metastases for the consciousness disturbance...

Assessment 
[Important Consultation]
05/09 Interventionist => For CT guide procedure
05/13 Anesthesiologist=> Port A removal
05/31 Neurologist     => Progressive bilateral lower leg weakness => suggest SSEP at first, and suggested MRI later
P.S. MRI was not suggested due to recent spinal implant.
06/05 Plastic surgeon => Debridement could only be performed with neurosurgeon's aid
06/06 Neurosurgeon => Operation would be performed only if Plastic surgeon wanted to debride
06/08 Interventionist=> for CT guide drainage and Pigtail insertion
06/20 pericardiocentesis due to cardiac tamponade
06/22 Bed-side debridement from PS doctor
      abdominal paracentesis with 3000ml ascites
7/1 oncologist Yen-Sheng Lu(盧彥伸)
    suggested tracheostomy could improved quality of life, 
    unless her families prefer direct DNR or further more, 
    removal of life-sustaining machine.
7/3 ID: PO vancomycin for CD colitis

[Image]
7/7 Increased right side pleural effusion

[Important interventions or newly added medications]
06/23 remove back pigtail
06/27 PP window creation

[Oncology treatment]
Detailed treatment please refer to previous note.

[Families decision]
the pateint, her husband and her mother declined tracheostomy.
They prefer re-intubation if failed to extubate.
