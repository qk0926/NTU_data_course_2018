Brief Summary of this week    
During 5/14~5/20
Her condition was stationary and no fever was noted. Tigecycline and fluconazole was stopped due to no culture evidence. Aspiration of paraspinal abscess showed negative. Port-A pseudomonas infection was suspected and it was removed on 5/16.
Massive ascites related to portal hypertension was found. She complained about abdominal distension which made her poor appetite and no ambulation. Intermittent paracentesis for symptom relief was performed. Lower limb weakness was found gradually. Long term bed-ridden related muscle atrophy was suspected amd physical therapeutist was consulted for rehabilitation.

Radiologist:
about 70ml serous to turbid fluid was drained smoothly
(fluid accumulation??)
NS VS ³¯´¯ªª:
debridement was not suggested in current condition
try Abx first with nutrition support for better wound healing
=>no culture evidence of infection

fever persisted after CT-guided drainage
port-A culture showed port-A¡@pseudomonas infection
=>port-A removal on 2016/5/16

dietitian was consulted for better nutrition
=>suggested double Calorie Ensure

VS¿c«Û¦ù:
paracentesis(2000-2500ml) twice per week
chemotherapy P-HDFL on W6


Plan 
. keep current Abx and pursue culture data
. supportive treatment(correct nutrition and electrolyte imbalance)
. remove CVC as soon as possible
. paracentesis twice per week
. chemotherapy P-HDFL on W6

PAP2

Assessment 
<Important Intervention and newly added medications>
04/22 ICU admission; Mepem; ETT+MV; CVVH via DLC
      Filgrastim 300 mcg QD for neutropenia
04/23 Potassium phosphate 44meq IF (AM), 44meq IF(Night)
04/25 Hold CVVH due to improved acidosis
04/25 Add Targocid due to persistent fever under Mempem
      Start slow NG feeding
04/26 DC G-CSF, nadir passed
04/28 Add Primperan for poor digestion
04/29 H/D (UF=2kg) once for fluid overload
      Right thoracentesis 550mL
05/01 Shift Mepem to Tatumcef
05/02 Extubation at 12:30; add Tigecycline and Diflucan for still low grade fever; taper Rasitol to 10mg QD

<Important consultation>
04/27 GI Fellow: for hyperbilirubinemia --> favor tumor or sepsis related
05/02 NS VS³¯´¯ªª: keep antibiotics; consider CT scan for poor wound healing
05/02 ID VS¬x°·²M: add Tigecycline to cover MDRAB
05/03 ID VS ¬x°·²M: May DC Targocid if no evidence of MRSA bacteremia

<Important family¡¦s decision>
04/22 Agreed with invasive procedure if indicated, including CVVH, DLC, intubation; favored aggressive resuscitation if circulatory collapse


PAP3

Assessment 
progressive right lower limb weakness after transferring from ICU

PT record on 5/10:
poo compliance of rehabilitation
right lower limb weakness was noted that time(MP:3-)
could stand for a while after training

PE showed numbness(stationary condition)
right quadriceps femoris weakness:2
distal muscle: 3

suspected myopathy of critical illness?
spinal cord compression was not likely due to slow progression
NE finding do not support either
CT on 5/4 showed no compression

Plan 
. consult PT for training again
. arrnage NCV/EMG
. nutrition support and encourage PT training
. ascites tapping for symptom relief
