Brief Summary of this week    
A new episode of fever developed since 6/29, we then discontinue Doripenam and administered ceftazidime and metronidazole empirically. Her fever subsided gradually on 7/2. At the meanwhile, her conciousness became clear without drowsiness. 

We then had this patient tried SBT via T-piece on 7/2. Her weaning parameters barely passed, but poor cough ability was noted(Her weakness was likely due to her spinal compression). She was clear and wished to extubate. However, we informed her high risk of failure suggested tracheostomy. The patient and her husband refused tracheostomy and preferred ETT + MV and try 

Fever relpased on 7/4. She became drowsy while she was frebile. 
We performed septic work-up, discontinued ceftazidime and metronidazoe, and initiated cravit + mepem empirically. Her fever subsided after one day of treatment and she became clear again. There was no definite infection focus during this episode. 

Contrast spine MRI was done on 7/4, which showed suspect diffuse arachnoiditis at thoracolumbar levels. CNS infection could not be ruled out, but her families refused lumbar puncture. 

For further improved her respiration-work, we'd performed paracentesis on 7/4 and 7/6, with 2500 ml ascites each time. However, she started to have tachycardia from 90 ppm to 145 ppm. The possible reason was insufficient effective volume, due to thrid space shift. Thus we aplied abumin supplement and slight hydration. Her tachycardia responsed poorly to hydration on 7/6. 

Nevertheless, fever developed again on 7/7 and a new infection was impressed. She became drowsy again. We'd checked her serum ammonia level and renal funciton and both werew within normalevels. We re-performed septic work-up and DC mepem to rule out carbapenam related drug-fever. Later, repeat wound culture yielded MDRAB, so we prescribed Colistin for suspect wound infection. Targocid and Cravit was discontinued due to poor evidence. However, her consciousness kept deteriorating. Pupil dilation to 6.0/6.0 mm was noted on 7/9. Light reflex was positive bilaterally.

Plan 
1. Administered Colitin for suspect wound MDRAB infx.
   -DC targocid due to no more evidence of MRSA
   -DC Cravit prolonged use with breakthrough fever.
   -Pursue ascites routine and culture.
   -Keep oral vancomycin to a 10 days course(-7/12)
2. Keep PS/PEEP:8/6 mmHg
   -- with hold weaning due to tachycardia and fever
3. Gentle hydration and consider albumin supplement
4. Keep wet-dressing to the spine OP wound, bosmin gause 
   packing due to active oozings. Component therapy as 
   needed.
5. If infection is under control, her conscoiusness 
   resumed and she passed SBT, consider extubate.
   (Inform her families the risk first)
6. DC MXL to rule out opioid overdose.

[Important Consultation]
05/09 Interventionist => For CT guide procedure
05/13 Anesthesiologist=> Port A removal
05/31 Neurologist     => Progressive bilateral lower leg weakness => suggest SSEP at first, and suggested MRI later
P.S. MRI was not suggested due to recent spinal implant.

06/06 Neurosurgeon => Operation would be performed only if Plastic surgeon wanted to debride
06/08 Interventionist=> for CT guide drainage and Pigtail insertion
06/20 pericardiocentesis due to cardiac tamponade
06/22 Bed-side debridement from PS doctor
      abdominal paracentesis with 3000ml ascites
7/1 oncologist Yen-Sheng Lu(¿c«Û¦ù)
    suggested tracheostomy could improved quality of life, 
    unless her families prefer direct DNR or further more, 
    removal of life-sustaining machine.
7/3 ID: PO vancomycin for CD colitis

[Oncology treatment]
Detailed treatment please refer to previous note.

[Families decision]
the pateint, her husband and her mother declined tracheostomy.
They prefer re-intubation if failed to extubate.
