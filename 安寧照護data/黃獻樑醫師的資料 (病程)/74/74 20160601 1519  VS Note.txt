Breast cancer with muiltiple mets, HER2 disease, but has refractory to herceptin, lapatinib. She has spine mets with cord compression s/p OP, XRT, but with complication of local wound healing problem in lower back and suspect abscess formation in the upper back. The abscess has become clear after antibiotics treatment. She has few brain mets that were relapse after WBRT. But the tumors are small, not a threaten. The current major problems are
1. massive liver mets with impending hepatic failure. massive clear ascites and bil. latgeral leg swelling noted (due to portal hypertension secondary to massive liver mets).
2. poor healing of back wound
3. bilateral leg weakness.
Clinically, the liver mets seems respond to PHDFL. 
AntiHER2 targeted therapy is not affordible by the family.
Plan: supportive care, and will give cycle 2 of PHDFL next weekend. becare of coming nadir, follow up hemogram regularly. (history of grade 4 neutropenia after vinorelbine sigle agent treatment)
