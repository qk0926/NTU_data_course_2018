Brief Summary of this week    
After transferred to our MICU, bed-side echo showed massive pericardial effusion with rocking heart. RV collapse was also noted over paraspinal short axis view. The CV doctor was consulted immediately for pericardiocentesis due to cardiac tamponade. The procedure was performed smoothly at bed-side and her tachycardia, lactic acidosis and hemodynamics stablized afterwards.
  However, spiking fever was noted since 6/21 and the OP wound condition also deteriorated with pus formation. Plasty surgeon was consulted and bed-side debridement was performed on 6/22. The fever seemed subsided a little however protracted fever persisted. The pericardial effusion drainage showed positive metastatic adenocarcinoma thus PP window creation was scheduled on 6/27 pm by CV doctor.
  Metabolis alkalosis was noted with low urine chloride level. Saline responsive was likely therefore modestly positive fluid balancing was maintain. The alkalosis improved gradually. The alkalosis related apnea also improved.
  Paracentesis was performed 6/22 with SAAG<1.1, ascites from extensive malignancy was most likely. 
  Antibiotics was switch to Colistin plus Targocid since 6/21 and added Doripenem since 6/25 for persisted high fever. Because of elevated ALP and GGT, hepatic tumor necrosis with abscess formation or osteomyelitis were both possible. Therefore, further imaging study (abdominal echo, spine MRI or Gaalium scan) would be considered if fever persisted despite multiple antibiotics treatment. 

Assessment 
Necrotic tissue with greenish discharge/odor were noted over her OP wound, new fever and tachypnea developed again
add on Ceftazidime for Proteus culture result
-> repeat septic work-up, f/u CXR, repeat urine culture,

<Antibiotics>
Colistin 6/21-    D4 fever with MDRAB+PsA w'd infection
Teicoplanin 6/21- D4 fever with MRSA  w'd infection
Ceftazidime 6/24- D1 for Proteus w'd infection

[Important Consultation]
05/09 Interventionist => For CT guide procedure
05/13 Anesthesiologist=> Port A removal
05/31 Neurologist     => Progressive bilateral lower leg weakness => suggest SSEP at first, and suggested MRI later
P.S. MRI was not suggested due to recent spinal implant.
06/05 Plastic surgeon => Debridement could only be performed with neurosurgeon's aid
06/06 Neurosurgeon => Operation would be performed only if Plastic surgeon wanted to debride
06/08 Interventionist=> for CT guide drainage and Pigtail insertion
06/20 pericardiocentesis due to cardiac tamponade
06/22 Bed-side debridement from PS doctor
      abdominal paracentesis with 3000ml ascites
06/23 remove back pigtail

Plan 
1. Keep Colistin + Targocid + Doripenem for 
   multiple bacteria colonization within the OP wound 
2. Add-on aldactone plus furosemide for ascites control, 
   abumin supplement for intra-vascular volume expansion 
   as needed
3. Administer low protein diet with daily sodium 
   restriction to 2 gm
4. Arrange PP window creation on coming Monday(by CV VS 
   陳盈憲) and extubation afterwards
5. Keep wet-dressing to the spine OP wound, bosmin gause 
   packing due to active oozings, pending culture result,
   consider add anaerobic coverage if persistent fever
6. Increase pain control with:
   Morphine MXL 60mg 1# BID
   Fentanyl patch 25mcg 1#-->2# Q3D
   Rescue dose morphine iv 15mg before wet-dressing
