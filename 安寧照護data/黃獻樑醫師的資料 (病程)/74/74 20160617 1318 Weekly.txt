Brief Summary of this week    
[Brief history]
     This 30-year old female had the history of high grade right breast intraductal carcinoma and this time was admitted to ICU due to severe neutropenic fever and septic shock. She was intubated for treatment and was extubated on 04/28. The patient was transferred to Oncology ward on 05/04.

[Treatment course]
    After transfering to general ward, low grade fever was still noted. Antibiotics(ceftazidime + Tigecycline + fluconazole) were kept for infection control. Computer tomography from head to pelvis was performed for evaluation on 5/5. Small brain metastases were found and liver tumor was stationary. 
    Paraspinal fat stranding was noted and abscess formation was suspected. Neurosurgeon VS³¯´¯ªª was consulted for further evaluation and he suggested confirming abscess formation with radiologist first. Radiologist was consulted and CT guide biopsy was performed on 5/10. About 70 ml fluid was drained but revealed no growth of bacteria. Blood culture showed persisted pseudomonas bacteremia. Culture from port-A showed pseudomonas growth in 5hours and Port-A removal carried on on 5/16.
Abdominal distension with ascites was noted. Paracentesis was performed on 5/11 and 2500ml was drained. Massive ascites related to portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia was suspected. She complained about abdominal distension which made her poor appetite and no ambulation. Intermittent paracentesis for symptom relief was performed. Lower limb weakness was found gradually. Long term bed-ridden related muscle atrophy was suspected amd physical therapeutist was consulted for rehabilitation. Her consicousness became drowsy and muscle power became worse around 5/24. Lab data showed no obvious metabolic factor except mild elevated ammonia level. Brain CT on 2016/5/27 showed multiple small metastases which were stationary. Lactulose for elevated ammonia level was given and her consciousness recovered. Transient hepatic encephalopathy was suspected. P-HDFL will be completed.
Neurologist was consulted for progressive lower limb weakness. Cord compression was not favored, but without a definite image they could not reach the final answer, and suggested to obtain spinal image if not contraindicated. However, due to her difficulty to lie down flat, we had order spinal CT instead. CT revealed 2 persisted paraspinal abscess on her back. Therefore, we had consulted neurosurgeon again, and they had replied that if plastic surgeon would perform debridement, they would combine the surgical intervention, but they thought that they patient may not be a good candidate for neurosurgery. Therefore, we had consulted the interventionist for drainage of the leision, and the procedure was performed on 06/10, and again clear fluid was drained without evidence of micro-organism growth.
      However, on 06/07, the patient had sudden onset of lower abdominal pain, gross hematuria, and fever. Lab data had revealed pyuria with GNB bacteremia. Therefore, we had started antibiotic treatment with Ceftazidime, and we would keep that for at least 14 days. 
     The patient would stay in the ward for further observation and antibiotic treatment.

[Consultation]
2016/06/06  Plastic surgeon: 
1.Please consult neurosurgeon for paraspinal abscess and further debridement. Combine operation will be needed.
2. VAC(cash) use was suggested after debridement.
2016/06/07  Neurosurgeon:
They had visited the patient and replied that the patient was not suitable for major surgery at present, if plastic surgeon would perform debridement, they are willing to aid them
2016/06/08 Interventionist: for drainage of paraspinal absces, will be performed on 06/10 PM

Plan 
. keep antibiotics treatment with Ceftazidime if spiking fever occurred, replace antibiotics with Amipicillin or add Vancomycin 
. paracentesis twice per week if necessary
=> the production speed of ascites had been decreased
. Consider arrange further intervention for paraspinal leisions if fever or bacteremia persited
