Brief Summary of this week    
We discontinued colistin and administered Cravit due to deteriorated renal function and prolonged fever. After we changed antibiotics, her fever subsided gradually. However, she remained comatose during this week. Due to terminal status and grave prognosis, we discussed withdraw with her families. They considered about it but still hesitated. 

We performed paracentesis occasionally to relieve abdominal tension. We consulted hospice team to educate her children about the concept 
of death. We consulted social worker for possible pension.
