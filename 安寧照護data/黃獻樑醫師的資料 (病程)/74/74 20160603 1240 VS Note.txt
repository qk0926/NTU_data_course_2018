breast cancer with multiple spine mets, extensive liver mets, and some brain mets after WBRT
previous upper spine abscess and large, deep wound over back (along mid spine)
massive ascites need periodic paracentesis

lower limb weakness, back wound pain

plan:
1. 5/5 CT showed abscess, but there was no following image to prove complete resolution, perhaps we need to repeat upper spine image together with brain image to clarify the cause of lower limb weakness
2. any chance of debridement??
3. follow up lab, hope to proceed P-HDFL next week
