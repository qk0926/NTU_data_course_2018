Brief Summary of this week    
During 5/21~5/27
her consicousness became drowsy and muscle power became worse. Lab data showed no obvious metabolic factor except mild elevated ammonia level. Brain CT on 2016/5/27 showed multiple small metastases which were stationary. Lactulose for elevated ammonia level was given and her consciousness recovered.
After discussion, P-HDFL will be completed.

dietitian was consulted for better nutrition
=>suggested double Calorie Ensure
=>could not eat well due to abdominal distension
=>TPN was considered about was not favored due to much fluid
=>try lipovenous 250ml QOD
=>attending agree TPN+lipovenous QOD
=>albumin level improved 

VS盧彥伸:
go on P-HFDL

Plan 
. supportive treatment(correct nutrition and electrolyte imbalance)
. paracentesis twice per week
. chemotherapy P-HDFL C1D8 on W6
. encourage embulation

PAP2

Assessment 
<Important Intervention and newly added medications>
04/22 ICU admission; Mepem; ETT+MV; CVVH via DLC
      Filgrastim 300 mcg QD for neutropenia
04/23 Potassium phosphate 44meq IF (AM), 44meq IF(Night)
04/25 Hold CVVH due to improved acidosis
04/25 Add Targocid due to persistent fever under Mempem
      Start slow NG feeding
04/26 DC G-CSF, nadir passed
04/28 Add Primperan for poor digestion
04/29 H/D (UF=2kg) once for fluid overload
      Right thoracentesis 550mL
05/01 Shift Mepem to Tatumcef
05/02 Extubation at 12:30; add Tigecycline and Diflucan for still low grade fever; taper Rasitol to 10mg QD

<Important consultation>
04/27 GI Fellow: for hyperbilirubinemia --> favor tumor or sepsis related
05/02 NS VS陳敞牧: keep antibiotics; consider CT scan for poor wound healing
05/02 ID VS洪健清: add Tigecycline to cover MDRAB
05/03 ID VS 洪健清: May DC Targocid if no evidence of MRSA bacteremia

<Important family’s decision>
04/22 Agreed with invasive procedure if indicated, including CVVH, DLC, intubation; favored aggressive resuscitation if circulatory collapse

PAP3

Assessment 
progressive right lower limb weakness after transferring from ICU

PT record on 5/10:
poo compliance of rehabilitation
right lower limb weakness was noted that time(MP:3-)
could stand for a while after training

PE showed numbness(stationary condition)
right quadriceps femoris weakness:2
distal muscle: 3

suspected myopathy of critical illness?
spinal cord compression was not likely due to slow progression
NE finding do not support either
CT on 5/4 showed no compression
NCV/EMG:
bilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy or motor neuropathy
=>etiology of progression??(無baseline NCV/EMG可比較)
numbness was stationary but muscle power became worse

Lab data on 5/26 showed no obvious metabolic factor which may interfere consciousness(NH3??)
=>image study was strongly indicated
=>staitonary tumor metastases
consciousness improved under lactulose??
transient hepatic encephalopathy showed be considered

Plan 
. stop lactulose due to improved consciousness and f/u NH3 level
. go on chemotherapy
. encourage ambulation
