60 year old man

[Active problems]
1. Community acquired pneumonia (3/3: Influenza virus type A RNA PCR: positive) with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and septic shock, status post ETT+MV (2016/3/3-), complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), status post V-V ECMO (2016/3/7-).
2. Hypokalemia, cause to be determined

[Inactive or chronic problems]
1. Diabetes mellitus, type 2

<Treatment course>
    After admission, we kept ECMO and ventilation support. Becaue poor digestion, we switched Tamiflu to Rapiacta use since 3/8. On 3/9, solu-medrol was prescribed. Besides, lasix was also given to keep I/O balance to mild negative. On 3/11, we tapered ventilator FiO2 from 80% to 70%. Sputum culture growed MDRAB (few) and SM (few), and we decided to keep OBS and repeated sputum culture. On 3/12, severe hypernatremia (Na: 161) with polyuria was noted. Urine osmolality was checked and we switched Anxicame to Dromicum use.

[Newly intervention and Medication]
3/07 Start V-V ECMO support
3/08 Switch Tamiflu to Rapiacta
3/09 Add Solu-medrol 40mg Q8H, add furosemide
3/10 hold furosemide due to adequate U/O
     add Nexium due to stool OB:3+

[Important patient's and family's decision]

<Plan>
**check anothr flu PCR to follow the effect of treatment**
1. Keep mechanical ventilation and try to weaning from V-V 
   ECMO support.
2. Keep Rapiacta since 3/8. Keep Tazocin use. Repeat 
   sputum culture. If newly developed fever or unstable 
   vital signs -> add Colistin to cover MDRAB.
3. Keep Fetanyl and Nimbex for ECMO use. Switch Anxicame to Dromicum because polyuria was found.
4. Keep Solu-medrol 40mg Q8H since 3/9.
5. adequate free water hydration to keep I/O balance and 
   hypernatremia
