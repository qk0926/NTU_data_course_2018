Brief Summary of this week    
After thoracentesis on 9/3, follow up CXR showed pneumothorax over left lower chest. We inserted pigtail for drainage on 9/5 and function was poor now(no air bubble was noted; however, pneumothorax was still noted via CXR). Pleural effusion drainage up to 450 ml per day was still noted. Furthermore, for lung collapse, we als ordered BiPAP 3 hours BID + overnight. VBG on 9/7 22:50 PM before overnight BiPAP showed CO2: 87.9 mmHg. Pigtail drainage with low pressure system was also ordered. Chest x ray on 9/8 showed no improvement of pneumothorax and lung collapse. We informed grave prognosis to family again. His son agreed no further blood drawing and chest x ray anymore. Mophrine use was considered if respirtory distress or pain was noted. 

Problem Assessment Plan   
          
PAP 1 
Assessment 
Cefepime for 9/5 sputum culture: KP 

Extubation on 8/30 afternoon, PES(+), resolved after Tx
O2 mask 28% 5LPM
weak cough power 
Thoracentesis 600ml transudate on 9/3, complicated with left pneumothorax
-> 9/5 CXR: progression -> pigtail drainage
-> 9/6 CXR: mildly improved
Poor lung expansion -> BiPAP

* Abnormal liver function
T-BIL:1.1->2.03, D-bil 0.69 -> indirect type
Hb 11->9.6
-> hemolysis?

8/18 Bedside-echo: gall stones, no thickened wall; no dilated CBD
HBsAg:Negative(0.01) IU/mL
Anti-HBs:Positive(400.91) mIU/mL
Anti-HBc:Positive *
Anti-HCV Ab:Negative *

[Previous Abx]
Mepem (8/1-14) for Ertapenem-R K.p.
Cravit (7/29-8/4) empirical, discontinue due to no evidecne of atypical pathogen infection
Tazocin (7/29-8/1)

[Cultures]
7/30 S/C: CRKP 1+, MRSA 1+
8/04 Pneumococcus Ag: Negative
     Urine Legionella Ag(-)
     Chlamydiae Antigen (-)
     Aspergillus Ag (-)
     Cryptococcal Ag (-)
     PJP PCR (-)
8/11 Burkholderia cepacia complex 1+
8/27 Anal- CR Klebsiella pneumoniae 1+
9/03 R't PEs - no bacteria visible

[Studies]
8/01 Right pleural effusion 520mL, serosaginuous, TP <3.0, LDH 344, glucose 111, RBC 11000, TNC 494, L:N:M+H 48:28:2, eos 22%
8/02 NECT chest: diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground glass opacities and consolidation; bilateral pleural effusion; status post TAVI and pacemaker placement
8/05 bed-side echo: minimal to moderate pleural effusion, bilateral; consolidation over parts of bilateral lower lungs; IVC 1.1cm with dynamic collapse
8/05 Brain perfusion: 
A. The dynamic flow study: 
* Mild to moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemisperes. 
* Increased flow to the paranasal region, which could be secondary to decreased brain perfusion/edema. 
B. The transaxial,coronal and sagittal images (SPECT) showed: 
* Symmetric moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemispheres, worst at left temporal and right frontal lobes; mild hypoperfusion to left basal ganglion, and right thalamus; preserved perfusion to right basal ganglion, left thalamus, and upper brainstem.
8/05 EEG:
EEG diagnosis: Abnormal EEG; nearly continuous diffuse slow waves at 5-7 Hz, 20-40 uV.  
EEG description: The EEG was performed when the patient was comatose. There are no alpha-range activities. There are rare scattered beta activities at 15-25 Hz, 5-10 uV in the anterior head areas. The EEG is characterized by nearly continuous diffuse slow waves at 5-7 Hz, 20-40 uV without obvious response to alerting maneuvers. (Hyperventilation is not performed. Photic stimulation elicites no definite photic driving responses.)
EEG interpertation: This EEG reveals moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. 

[Consultation]
8/9 Neurologist:
EEG showed cortical activity. He may regain consciousness, but whether keeping bed-ridden is not predictable.
May repeat EEG on 8/12 or later.

[Family decision]
8/9 病人兒子表示不氣切，希望找個時機拔管，若拔管失敗也不重插
8/15 Patient's family reconsidered about tracheostomy
8/18 病人兒子決定先不拔管，將準備外轉至RCW
8/25 決定拔管，預計8/30
9/01 Hesitate for thoracentesis
9/04 asked about pneumothorax

[Intervention]
9/01 Albumin supplement and diuresis for left PEs
9/03 left thoracentesis 600ml transudate, complicated with pneumothorax
9/05 Left pigtail insertion for pneumothorax

Plan 
1. Post-extubation care
2. Keep symptomatic treatment
3. Left chest pigtail and BiPAP 3 hours BID + overnight; 
   monitor drainage function, connect to low pressure 
   suction system 
-  Monitor oxygenation and follow up bedside echo for left 
   pneumothorax
4. Add Tazocin empirically for increased sputum, shifted to cefepime for sputum culture: KP
