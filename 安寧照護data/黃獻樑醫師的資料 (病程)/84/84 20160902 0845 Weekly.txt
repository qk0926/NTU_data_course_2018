Brief Summary of this week    
This week, extubation was performed on 8/30. Mild wheezing and stridor were noted after extubation. Combivent and solu cortef were given. Respiration was smooth then. Oxygen demend was kept at 8L/35%. If clinical condition is generally stationary, he will be transfered to 5CD for further management and evaluation next W1.

PAP 1 
Assessment 
Abx free

extubation on 8/30 afternoon, PES(+), resolved after Tx
O2 mask 28% 5LPM
-> SpO2 99-100% on 8/31 → 95-97% on 9/1
-> weak cough power 
-> Bedside echo: no pneumothorax, no obvious lung edema,
                 bil. pleural effusion, L>R
-> CXR in series showed chronic effusion, no progression
-> F/u CXR tomorrow

[Studies]
8/01 Right pleural effusion 520mL, serosaginuous, TP <3.0, LDH 344, glucose 111, RBC 11000, TNC 494, L:N:M+H 48:28:2, eos 22%
8/02 NECT chest: diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground glass opacities and consolidation; bilateral pleural effusion; status post TAVI and pacemaker placement
8/05 bed-side echo: minimal to moderate pleural effusion, bilateral; consolidation over parts of bilateral lower lungs; IVC 1.1cm with dynamic collapse
8/05 Brain perfusion: 
A. The dynamic flow study: 
* Mild to moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemisperes. 
* Increased flow to the paranasal region, which could be secondary to decreased brain perfusion/edema. 
B. The transaxial,coronal and sagittal images (SPECT) showed: 
* Symmetric moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemispheres, worst at left temporal and right frontal lobes; mild hypoperfusion to left basal ganglion, and right thalamus; preserved perfusion to right basal ganglion, left thalamus, and upper brainstem.
8/05 EEG:
EEG diagnosis: Abnormal EEG; nearly continuous diffuse slow waves at 5-7 Hz, 20-40 uV.  
EEG description: The EEG was performed when the patient was comatose. There are no alpha-range activities. There are rare scattered beta activities at 15-25 Hz, 5-10 uV in the anterior head areas. The EEG is characterized by nearly continuous diffuse slow waves at 5-7 Hz, 20-40 uV without obvious response to alerting maneuvers. (Hyperventilation is not performed. Photic stimulation elicites no definite photic driving responses.)
EEG interpertation: This EEG reveals moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. 

* Abnormal liver function
T-BIL:1.74 →1.1
AST/ALT: fluctuated value
8/18 Bedside-echo: gall stones, no thickened wall; no dilated CBD
HBsAg:Negative(0.01) IU/mL
Anti-HBs:Positive(400.91) mIU/mL
Anti-HBc:Positive *
Anti-HCV Ab:Negative *

[Consultation]
8/9 Neurologist:
EEG showed cortical activity. He may regain consciousness, but whether keeping bed-ridden is not predictable.
May repeat EEG on 8/12 or later.

[Family decision]
8/9 病人兒子表示不氣切，希望找個時機拔管，若拔管失敗也不重插
8/15 Patient's family reconsidered about tracheostomy
8/18 病人兒子決定先不拔管，將準備外轉至RCW
8/25 決定拔管，預計8/30

[Intervention]
nil

Plan 
1. Post-extubation care
   Closely observation for few days then transfer to 
   ordinary ward next W1
2. Keep symptomatic treatment
