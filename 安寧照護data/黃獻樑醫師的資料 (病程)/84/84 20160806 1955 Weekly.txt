Brief Summary of this week    
After transferred to 3A2 ICU on 8/3, Mepem was kept for the Ertapenem-resistent K.p.. MV setting was switched from PCV to PSV on 8/3. However, due to collapse over lower lungs, MV setting was switched from PSV to VC+SIMV on 8/5. Minimal ascites and bilateral pleural effusion were noted but IVC showed dynamic collapse, which indicated insufficient intravascular volume so that self-paid albumin was given during 8/5-7. After tapering down Fentanyl, his consciousness recovered with eye tracing with contact since 8/5.

[PE]
Consciousness: E4M4Vt, with eye tracing with contact
Heart: systolic murmur at RUSB
BS: bilateral rhonchi
Abdomen: BoS normoactive, soft
Extremities: warm, pitting edema (+)

[Studies]
8/01 Right pleural effusion 520mL, serosaginuous, TP <3.0, LDH 344, glucose 111, RBC 11000, TNC 494, L:N:M+H 48:28:2, eos 22%
8/02 NECT chest: diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground glass opacities and consolidation; bilateral pleural effusion; status post TAVI and pacemaker placement
8/05 bed-side echo: minimal to moderate pleural effusion, bilateral; consolidation over parts of bilateral lower lungs; IVC 1.1cm with dynamic collapse
8/05 EEG:
8/05 Brain perfusion: 
A. The dynamic flow study: 
* Mild to moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemisperes. 
* Increased flow to the paranasal region, which could be secondary to decreased brain perfusion/edema. 
B. The transaxial,coronal and sagittal images (SPECT) showed: 
* Symmetric moderate hypoperfusion to bilateral cerebral hemispheres, worst at left temporal and right frontal lobes; mild hypoperfusion to left basal ganglion, and right thalamus; preserved perfusion to right basal ganglion, left thalamus, and upper brainstem.

[Family decision]
[Intervention]

Plan 
1. Post resuscitation care; wait for EEG report.
2. Keep Mepem for CRKp pneumonia. 
3. Monitor pleural effusion amount; repeat thoracocentesis if much amount or atelectasis (to rule out empyema)
-- 8/01 Right pleural effusion 520mL: exudate, lymphocyte predominant
4. Give Albumin supplement for 3 days for inappropriate intravascular volumn. Keep Lasix and Aldactone use.
5. Diet water restriction.
