Brief Summary of this week    
The family mentioned about the willing of withdrawing life supporting devices. A family meeting was arranged with Dr. 許嘉林. After discussion, they decided to wait for one week. If the patient's condition improved, treatments will be maintained, otherwise withdrawal will be considered again. The condition was stable one week later. Since the patient had mentioned that he did not want to be intubated when he was clear, the family decided to respect the patient's will. Extubation will be done, on the date the family are still discussing.
