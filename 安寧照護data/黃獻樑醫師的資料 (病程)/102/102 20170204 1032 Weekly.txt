Brief Summary of this week    
The family mentioned about the willing of withdrawing life supporting devices. A family meeting was arranged with Dr. 許嘉林. After discussion, they decided to wait for one week. If the patient's condition improved, treatments will be maintained, otherwise withdrawal will be considered again. The condition was stable in this week. We will have further discussion with the family on the following week.
