Brief Summary of this week    
[Brief history]
    This is a 72 year old male with history of lung cancer with bone metastasis. He came to our ER for dyspnea and RUL/RLL pneumonia with left side massive pleural effusion was noticed.

[Treatment course]
    After admission, we inserted pigtail to right chest for pleural effusion drainage. We drained 1000mL per day at first and his pleural effusion gradually decreased.  For right lung pneumonia, we kept Levofloxacin and Tazocin treatment, and later discontinued Tazocin for no evidence. 
    The patient had desaturation under venturi mask support with 98% 10L/min, and thus we kept BiPAP support for the patient. He had well saturation under BiPAP support. The patient had signed DNR at first but later withdrew after being persuaded by his family.
    The patient would stay in the ward for intensive monitoring and we would transfer the patient if he had stable conditions under BiPAP support.

[Nutrition]
高蛋白配方 1.5大卡/ml   1500Kcal/day

[Important intervention and newly added medications]
01/04 C1D1 Cisplatin + Alimta
01/17 Thoracentesis 1000ml (Single tapping, PE sent for study)
01/17 pigtail insertion 500ml drained
01/17 BiPAP support
01/18 pigtail drained 1000mL
01/19 pigtail drained 410mL  
01/20 pigtail drained 90mL  => bedside echo/CXR revealed decreased pleural effusion

[Important consultation]

[Important patient's and family's decisions]
DNR signed by himself
01/17 Decided intubation if needed
01/18 Patient signed DNR全拒 on his own will, withdrew later

Plan 
1. For Rt lobar pneumonia with impending respiratory failure
  -keep Cravit, pursue cultures data 
  => consider replace Levofloxacin if still no improvement on pneumonia
  -Keep BiPAP, follow CXR QD/QOD
  -If worsening ABG or respiratory pattern, intubate the patient
  -check flu PCR and AFS/culture
2. For pleural effusion
  -keep drainage with pigtail catheter QOD
  -pursue culture results from effusion
3. For lung cancer
  -C1D1 Cisplatin+Pemetrexed on 1/4, further anti-cancer therapy is not feasible currently
