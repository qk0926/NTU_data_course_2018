[Consultation]
Endocrine: Free T4 0.73 TSH 150
Give Eltroxin 0.25# QD, may follow free T4/TSH QW, arrange thyroid echo after stablization.
Check autoimmune profile

ID: shift to colistin to cover pseudomonas and CRKP

Derma:
1. Stasis dermatitis with bullous formation, rule out lipodermatosclerosis, lower legs
2. Suspected bullous pemphigoid, rule out frictional blisters
Please check the causes of veous stasis, such as deep vein thrombosis, for this patient.
Please apply cort-S twice daily to the violaceous plaques on the legs.

10/8 Hospice for DNR extubation
: Please formal consultation when working day

Plan 
1. Keep Abx with colistin for 7 days
2. Blood component therapy for anemia 
3. Dopamine infusion and monitor BP and U/O
4. Albumin supplement followed by diuretics
5. Give Eltroxin 0.25# QD, may follow free T4/TSH QW, arrange thyroid echo after stablization
6. Discuss with family about DNR extubation
7. Informed family the poor prognosis, they confirmed the DNR and no hemodialysis,
8. Formal hospice consultation on next W2
