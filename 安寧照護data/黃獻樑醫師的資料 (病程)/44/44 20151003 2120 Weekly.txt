Brief Summary of this week 
We shifted Tazocin to Cefepime for elevated liver function since 9/30. However, elevated liver function might probably due to amiodarone use. 
   About hemoptysis, radiologist had done TAE at right bronchial artery on 2015/10/1. No gross hemoptysis was found later. 
   Fever up to 38'C ocurred on 9/30 midnight. On 10/2, bronchial washing sputum reported Tazocin-resistant Enterobacter. Thus, we kept Cefepime use. Escalate antibiotic to carbapenem if recurrent fever. 
   For poor resolution of left VAP, tracheostomy was suggested. However, the patient was very angry and refused it. Prepare RCC transfer next week.

Plan 
1. Keep cefepime for Enterobacter cloacae in the sputum, consider escalated to carbapenem if still low grade fever for possible developing AmpC pathogen
   Discontinue Voriconazole 
2. Enhance chest care and sputum suction; keep SpO2 around 
   88%~95% to avoid CO2 retention due to COPD
3. About tracheostomy, 兒子希望氣切，但病人及兩個女兒都拒絕，最終決定尚未出來。
      - prepare RCC transfer next week 
4. may taper Transamin use if decreasing hemosputum and 
   hold Coumadin since 9/19; component therapy if indicated
5. Electrolyte correction for short-run VT and VPC 
   bigeminy if indicated (K>4, Mg>1, Ca>2.2);
   close monitor I/O and renal function
   Set dry weight as 45kg

PAP4
Assessment 
09/23 CV VS陳盈憲: Coumadin was used instead of NOAC because there was a definite marker (INR) to monitor its effect; NOAC is not suitable for patients with renal insufficiency; Coumadin could be DC because of persistent hemoptysis
09/23 ID VS盤松青: 6-month treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis is sufficient, and this event is not compatible with the natural course (too acute); suggest to add Vfend if further culture evidence or high Aspergillus Ag titer
09/24 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: favor MGUS, check "bone survey" if his condition is tolerable; bone marrow study is considered
09/28 CV Fellow 許容綺: VPC bigeminy can be treated with Cordarone or Lidocaine if unstable hemodynamics; increasing Rytmonorm dosage is not recommended because it would cause bradycardia
09/29 CV VS陳盈憲: Rytmonorm could be DC, keep Cordarone for VPCs, but could be DC as well if Afib with MVR
09/30 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: lab data and PB smear showed no evidence of hemolysis
09/30 CV VS陳盈憲: DC Cordarone if drug-related abnormal liver function is suspected; do not add back digoxin due to drug-drug interaction with cordarone; if afib with RVR/VT with unstable hemodynamics, add back cordarone 0.5PC QD and slowly increase dosage
09/30 Radiologist 梁博欽: elective TAE will be arranged on 10/01 VS盤松青 & VS鄭之勛: pulmonary Aspergillosis is less likely. Voriconazole could be discontinued.
