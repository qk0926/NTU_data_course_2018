Brief Summary of this week 
Tazocin and Vfend were administered for pneumonia and pulmonary aspergillosis, and Transamine for hemoptysis. Fever subsided, and CO2 retention improved under ventilator support. His consciousness became clearer, and hemoptysis amount mildly decreased. CXR showed slow resolution of LLL infiltration. In addition, A/G reverse was found, so SPEP, UPEP and IFE were checked. Serum electrophoresis revealed a paraprotein peak (13.2%) in gamma region; and urine IFE showed a very dense band of kappa light chain Bence-Jones proteins; free kappa/lambda ratio 17.7632. Hematologist was consulted, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was suspected, suggesting bone marrow biopsy study.
 Short-run ventricular tachycardia was observed at 9/25 night, and electrolyte showed Na=136, K=5.0, Ca=1.96, Mg=0.97, and normal cardiac enzymes. Digoxin was held, and Cordarone 150mg IF was administered. His heart rate returned to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response afterward.
 We had informed the family about the risk of massive hemoptysis and the indication of TAE, and they agreed. They also agreed tracheostomy if weaning program fails.
Bronchoscopy will be performed next week if hemoptysis didnot improve.

Plan 
1. Keep Tazocin and Vfend; pursue complete culture results; check Aspergillus Ag QW1,4
2. Enhance chest care and sputum suction; keep SpO2 around 88%~95% to avoid CO2 retention due to COPD
3. Monitor respiratory pattern, ABG and CXR
4. informed his family of the possibility of tracheostomy creation if poor weaning condition and long-term care
5. Keep Transamin use for hemosputum and hold Coumadin since 9/19; component therapy if indicated
6. Keep Rytmonorm for permanent Af; keep balanced I/O and BW; recheck serum Digoxin level next week
7. contact hematologist for BM study
8. consider bronchoscopy study next week if hemoptysis doesnot improve

NH3=31, LA=1.13, Na=134, K=4.5, ABG pH= 7.383, PCO2=62, PO2=94.5, HCO3=37.3
24-hour urine IFE shows a very dense band of kappa light chain Bence-Jones proteins; free kappa/lambda ratio 17.7632  (H), kappa free light chain 2700.00  mg/L (H), lambda free light chain 152.00 (H), Kappa/Lambda ratio 6.2371, EKG:Af

<Important intervention and newly added medications>
Home BiPAP use during sleeping time (around 9~12hr/day), baseline PCO2 around 65mmHg
09/20 Keep BiPAP use for CO2 retention and desaturation (ER: SpO2=49%); hold OPD Coumadin due to hemosputum; give empirical Unasyn for pneumonia; add bronchodilators and Siruta inhalation; add Transamin for hemosputum
09/21 Add Vfend 1# BID for positive Aspergillus Ag
09/22 Consciousness disturbance with progressive CO2 retention s/p ETT+MV; upgrade Unasyn to Tazocin; 6E1 admission; shift Siruta to Encore due to much sputum; taper Transamin dose
09/23 Taper Vfend to 0.5# BID; shift IV Transamin to inhaled form (500mg Q6H)
09/25 Cordarone loading for short run VT, check electrolytes, digoxin level
09/26 DC Digoxin, Kalimate 1PC TID for K=5.0

<Important consultation>
09/23 CV VS陳盈憲: Coumadin was used instead of NOAC because there was a definite marker (INR) to monitor its effect; NOAC is not suitable for patients with renal insufficiency; Coumadin could be DC because of persistent hemoptysis
09/23 ID VS盤松青: 6-month treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis is sufficient, and this event is not compatible with the natural course (too acute); suggest to add Vfend if further culture evidence or high Aspergillus Ag titer
09/24 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: favor MGUS, check "bone survey" if his condition is tolerable; bone marrow study is considered

<Important patient's and family's decision>
09/23 Family: no CPCR; hesitated tracheostomy and TAE (if massive hemoptysis)
09/24 Family: agreed with TAE if massive hemoptysis; agreed tracheostomy (已給衛教單張及看影片介紹); didn't favor right pneumonectomy





































09/25 agreed bone marrow biopsy next week
