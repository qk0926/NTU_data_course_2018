Brief Summary of this week 
This week, deteriorating PF ratio and exacerbated dyspnea were found. CXR showed progressed left lung consolidation pathcy lesion. On 10/6, sputum culture from bronchial washing grew Stenotrophomonas. After discussion with ID specialist, we initiated Cravit and Sevatrim for it. We also titrated up sedative drugs for venilator compliance. His respiratory gradually became smooth. On 10/9, family meeting was held for explaining the current condition. We also offered withdrawal or RCW transfer option depends on patient's condition.

Plan 
1. Keep Cravit and Baktar for Stenotrophomas and Enterobacter coverage due to progressive necrotizing penumonia
   - try to taper sedative drugs
2. Family signed DNR and refused changing endotracheal tube if being stuck
3. Enhance chest care and sputum suction
4. Supportive care. Withdrawal or RCW transfer depends on the patient's condition.

PAP4
Assessment
09/23 CV VS陳盈憲: Coumadin was used instead of NOAC because there was a definite marker (INR) to monitor its effect; NOAC is not suitable for patients with renal insufficiency; Coumadin could be DC because of persistent hemoptysis
09/23 ID VS盤松青: 6-month treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis is sufficient, and this event is not compatible with the natural course (too acute); suggest to add Vfend if further culture evidence or high Aspergillus Ag titer
09/24 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: favor MGUS, check "bone survey" if his condition is tolerable; bone marrow study is considered
09/28 CV Fellow 許容綺: VPC bigeminy can be treated with Cordarone or Lidocaine if unstable hemodynamics; increasing Rytmonorm dosage is not recommended because it would cause bradycardia
09/29 CV VS陳盈憲: Rytmonorm could be DC, keep Cordarone for VPCs, but could be DC as well if Afib with MVR
09/30 Hematology Fellow 姚啟元: lab data and PB smear showed no evidence of hemolysis
09/30 CV VS陳盈憲: DC Cordarone if drug-related abnormal liver function is suspected; do not add back digoxin due to drug-drug interaction with cordarone; if afib with RVR/VT with unstable hemodynamics, add back cordarone 0.5PC QD and slowly increase dosage
09/30 Radiologist 梁博欽: elective TAE will be arranged on 10/01
10/6 ID 洪: Since Enterobacter pneumonia in progression with Stenotrophomonas, may shift antibiotics to Cravit and sevatrim for combination use. Pending for fungus culture of bronchial washing. For Aspergillosis and NTM are also possible pathogens.

PAP5
Assessment 
09/23 Family: no CPCR; hesitated tracheostomy and TAE (if massive hemoptysis)
09/24 Family: agreed with TAE if massive hemoptysis; agreed tracheostomy (已給衛教單張及看影片介紹); didn't favor right pneumonectomy
09/25 Family: agreed with bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy next week
09/29 Family: agreed with bone marrow biopsy and bronchoscopy postponed to 09/30
10/01 TAE to right bronchial artery
10/05 due to deteriorating PNA, his family want to sign DNR if critical
10/09 Family meeting
