This 87 y/o woman has sufferred from the diseases of
1. Basilar artery and bilateral posterior cerebral artery occlusion, day 1 = 2016/02/08, status post ETT+MV (2016/2/8~ )
2. Atrial fibrillation
3. Old pulmonary tuberculosis, status post treatment

She was found sudden collapse at around 10:00AM on 2016/02/08, and then was sent to our ER. Brainstem stroke was impressed, and brain CT perfusion revealed BA to bilateral PCA occlusion with posterior infarct. Endotracheal tube was inserted for airway protection, and the patient was soon admitted to the stroke ICU for further management.

She remained E1M2~3Vt, with absent pupil light reflex, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, and general muscle power was 0~2 grade upon noxious stilmuli. Poor prognosis was informed. The family has signed DNR (except drugs, and except intubation which was already done.)

Poor respiratory condition was noted by RT team, and tracheostomy rather than extubation was suggested. However after discussion with her family members, tracheostomy is not considered. They would like to follow the palliative care according to 安寧緩和條例. Now they are discussing about the issue of withdrawal of ventilator/endotracheal tube.

We sincerely consult your expertise for evaluation, and if it is possible for ward transfer to 安寧緩和病房 as requested by the family. We would re-signed the DNR after confirming with the family.
