A 87-year-old woman with acute BAO on 2016/2/8 associated with infarct at bilateral pons, midbrain, thalamus, and the left medial temporal lobe, and the left occipital lobe.
After seiral discussion in family conference, family preferred extubation to avoid long-term respiratory support with vegetative status.

Pre-extubation status:
SIMV+PS mode, RRset/total 8/23, VT 280ml; FiO2 30%, SpO2 100%
NE still showed absence of light reflex and corneal reflex.
E1M3Vt
Extubation was done on 2016/2/28 at 10:28AM.
Solu-cortef, Buscopan, O2, and Morphine were given to prevent discomfort.
No obvious struggle or discomfort appearance under current medical treatment. 
I have explained the current condition to family via phone call and will keep current management with the goal of discomfort prevention.
