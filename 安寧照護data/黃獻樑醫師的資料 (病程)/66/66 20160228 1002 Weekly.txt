Brief Summary of this week    
Poor respiratory condition was noted by respiratory specialist, who suggested tracheostomy with long-term ventilator use. We arranged family meeting on 2/24. After thorough explanation and discussion, the family decided not to receive tracheostomy, and preferred endotracheal tube withdrawal under the palliative policy for end-of-life patient. We consulted hospice team for combined care.
On 2/26, fever was noted, and pneumonia was suspected. Unasyn was administered. 
Endotracheal tube removal is arranged on 2/28 10AM.

2. Keep Unasyn.
3. Morphine if respiratory discomfort as palliative care
