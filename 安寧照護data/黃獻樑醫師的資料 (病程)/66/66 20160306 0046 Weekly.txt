Brief Summary of this week    
[Treatment Course]
  Brain CT follow-up on 2/9 showed recent infarct at midbrain to thalami, and left temporo-occipital lobe; no ICH was noted. Aspirin was added for stroke prevention. Do Not Resuscitate consent was signed. No improvement could be noted in neurological examination. Weaning was tried, but tracheostomy instead of extubation was suggested by pulmonary specialist due to her underlying condition.
  We arranged family meeting on 2/24. After thorough explanation and discussion, the family decided not to receive tracheostomy, and preferred endotracheal tube withdrawal under the palliative policy for end-of-life patient. We consulted hospice team for combined care. On 2/26, fever was noted, and pneumonia was suspected. Unasyn was administered. 
  Endotracheal tube was removed on 2/28 10AM. Morphine pump was used for respiratory distress. Aspirin was held due to hematuria. We kept palliative care.

Plan 
DNR(+)(全拒, 不插管不氣切)
1. Keep Combined care with the hospice team 
2. Morphine if respiratory distress, and keep palliative care
3. Keep other supportive treatment; stop inhalation therapy since suction content only showed bile juice
4. General ward transfer next week if vital sign is maintained
