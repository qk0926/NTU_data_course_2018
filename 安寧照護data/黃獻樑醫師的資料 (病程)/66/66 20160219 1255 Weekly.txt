Brief Summary of this week    
ETT+MV was kept this week. For weaning we used CPAP+PS on day time and SIMV+PS as nocturnal support. No improvement could be noted in neurological examination.
Family meeting will be arranged next week for further planning.

Plan 
DNR(+)(°£ÃÄ°£´¡ºÞ)
1. Consider follow brain image if any change but inform family about poor prognosis.
2. Keep aspirin for stroke prevention.
3. Keep weaning. Discuss with family for further plan of elective extubation or trachestomy. (now favoring palliative care)
4. Family conference in the next week.
