[Treatment course of this week]
We kept tapering inotropic agent. CAG was done with ECMO and IABP suppport on 2015/11/5. However, POBAS failed due to difficult approach. Lung edema was noted after CAG and we kept CAVH.

[Important interventions and Newly Added Medications]
10/29  CPCR, ETT/MV. ECMO
       POBAS to RCA (DES*3), POBA to LCX, failed to pass LAD
       Dopamine for cardiogenic shock		
10/30  Bradycardia on Bosmin pump
       CAVH for pulmonary edema and decrease urine output

[Important consultation]
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: Heart stunning. Keep observation.
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: suggest CAVH for poor urine output
       keep obs till next W2, consider intervention
       of LAD. Try taper the setting of ECMO
10/31  Radiologist: Lt MCA density was the same as VA. Besides, no hypodense lesion over MCA territory. MCA infarction was less likely.
10/31  Neurologist­S: infarction was less likely. Suspect HIE and hypoperfusion related seizure.

[Important Patient and Family Decisions]
10/30  Inform poor prognosis, aggressive treatment

[Plan]
1. Keep heparinization for LV thrombus/IABP/ECMO.
2. CAVH with titrate UF for lung congestion
3. Keep ECMO 
   Try weaning if tolerable
4. Keep empirical ceftazidime and vancomycin
5. Inform to the family about poor prognosis
