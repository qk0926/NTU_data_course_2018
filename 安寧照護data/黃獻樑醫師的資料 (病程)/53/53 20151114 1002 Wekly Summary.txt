[Treatment course of this week]
We kept CAVH for fluid overload. His weight decreased nearly 10Kg in a week. His CVP was relatively low and systemic BP got lower. Low intravascular volume was favored. We added coloid support and continued weaning ECMO.

       Dopamine for cardiogenic shock		
10/30  Bradycardia on Bosmin pump
       CAVH for pulmonary edema and decrease urine output

[Important consultation]
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: Heart stunning. Keep observation.
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: suggest CAVH for poor urine output
       keep obs till next W2, consider intervention
       of LAD. Try taper the setting of ECMO
10/31  Radiologist: Lt MCA density was the same as VA. Besides, no hypodense lesion over MCA territory. MCA infarction was less likely.
10/31  Neurologist­S: infarction was less likely. Suspect HIE and hypoperfusion related seizure.
11/3  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: arrange cath under ECMO on W4
11/9  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: favor further PCI over CABG
11/11 VS §õ¥ô¥ú: titrate UF to keep I/O balance!! PCI would be arranged next week

[Important Patient and Family Decisions]
10/30  Inform poor prognosis, aggressive treatment

[Plan]
1. Keep heparinization for LV thrombus/IABP/ECMO, continue clopidogrel. Monitor for bleeding (hematuria + hematemesis). Add aspirin if bleeding improves
2. Keep Cordarone for AfRVR during ultrafiltration 
   => Switch to oral form today due to longer QTc
3. Keep Albumin supplement for low intravascular volume 
4. On CAVH, titrate UF for lung congestion, monitor BP+HR, keep I/O balcnce, CVC goal 10-12. Target BW=62Kg 
5. Keep Mepem
   DC Vancomycin today
6. Taper ECMO flow if feasible. Continue IABP and inotropics
7. PCI arranged next week, consider surgery if CAG still failed.
