Brief Summary of this week 
We added Cubicin under the consider of CRBSI(IABP B/C:VSE)CAG was done on 2015/11/18 again. POBAS to LM-LCx was done. However, inotropic agent and ECMO flow increased due to worsened hemodynamic status. Fever took place on 2015/11/19 with AFRVR. We switched antibiotics to Cubicin+Mepem+Eraxis after discussion with VS²ø¯§¤¤. B/C yielded VSE again and IABP infection was impressed. We began tapering IABP after discussion with VS¬ö¤D·s from 2015/11/21.

Plan
1. Keep heparinization for LV thrombus/IABP/ECMO, continue clopidogrel. Monitor for bleeding (hematuria + hematemesis). Add aspirin if bleeding improves 
2. Amidarone for A-fib RVR with aberrant conduction
3. Keep Cubicin, Mepem, anidulafungin for new spesis and CRBSI
4. On CAVH, titrate UF for lung congestion if shock stablized. monitor BP+HR, CVC goal 10-12
5. Remove IABP ASAP if BP tolerable
6. Inform family about critical condition, the patient favor DNR if new sepsis with profound shock
7. Consult CVS for MICS CABG if infection improve.

PAP3
Assessment 
[Important interventions and Newly Added Medications]
10/29  CPCR, ETT/MV. ECMO
       POBAS to RCA (DES*3), POBA to LCX, failed to pass LAD
       Dopamine for cardiogenic shock		
10/30  Bradycardia on Bosmin pump
       CAVH for pulmonary edema and decrease urine output
11/9   Chest tapping:1000ml brown fluid, lab exam sent
11/20  Wide QRS arrthymia: DC shock 3 times, cardioversion 2 times& DC shock one time

[Important consultation]
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: Heart stunning. Keep observation.
10/30  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: suggest CAVH for poor urine output
       keep obs till next W2, consider intervention
       of LAD. Try taper the setting of ECMO
10/31  Radiologist: Lt MCA density was the same as VA. Besides, no hypodense lesion over MCA territory. MCA infarction was less likely.
10/31  Neurologist­S: infarction was less likely. Suspect HIE and hypoperfusion related seizure.
11/3  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: arrange cath under ECMO on W4
11/9  VS §õ¥ô¥ú: favor further PCI over CABG
11/11 VS §õ¥ô¥ú: titrate UF to keep I/O balance!! PCI would be arranged next week
11/19 VS §õ¥ô¥ú: discuss with Dr.¬ö¤D·s for mid CABG for LAD-CTO
11/21 VS ¬ö¤D·s:Weaning IABP, control septsis before OP

[Important Patient and Family Decisions]
10/30  Inform poor prognosis, aggressive treatment
11/16  Family agreed to attempt PCI to LAD CTO again, agreed to mini-CABG in case of failure to revascularize LAD
11/20 Agree current critical condition due to new sepsis, hope not CPCR or cardioversion/defrbrillation
