Brief Summary of this week
In this week, one episode of fever was noted on 11/23. Chest X-ray showed increased left lung infiltration , so we added vancomycin. On 11/25, sputum culture showed Fortum-resistent pseudomonas, so we added Ciprocin. After that, no fever was noted. We would keep close monitoring.
